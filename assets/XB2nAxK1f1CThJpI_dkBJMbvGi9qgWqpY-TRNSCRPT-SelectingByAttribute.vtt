00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.826
In this video, we're going to be
using the Select by Attributes

4f9e2a4e-eeb5-4382-82cb-6b52e12db2bb-1
00:00:07.826 --> 00:00:13.379
tool to see how many of our
sighting points occurred in each

4f9e2a4e-eeb5-4382-82cb-6b52e12db2bb-2
00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.200
type of environment.

8f85d0a0-d49c-45f5-845a-da17462d2b64-0
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.249
So the first thing we need to
make sure is that none of our

8f85d0a0-d49c-45f5-845a-da17462d2b64-1
00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:21.920
data is already selected.

d689be97-23d2-4a5d-b849-69730144fbc2-0
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.582
So we can go into the Selection
section of the Map tab and click

d689be97-23d2-4a5d-b849-69730144fbc2-1
00:00:27.582 --> 00:00:29.640
on this Clear button here.

1ae35c83-de83-4eef-b498-4a13ed490148-0
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.093
And now we're going to select
our sighting points, so just

1ae35c83-de83-4eef-b498-4a13ed490148-1
00:00:38.093 --> 00:00:41.360
make sure those are highlighted
in our contents.

323ce91a-0fc2-465d-a9d2-87dbd124a99d-0
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.320
And we're going to click on the
Select by Attributes button

323ce91a-0fc2-465d-a9d2-87dbd124a99d-1
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.440
which is going to bring up this
window.

e4b57305-2707-4d08-bcd6-3084959225da-0
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.438
And so in the input row we want
this to be our sighting points

e4b57305-2707-4d08-bcd6-3084959225da-1
00:00:55.438 --> 00:00:58.440
as this is the layer that we're
selecting.

675b2dab-8060-40d4-98f3-f7ce9404677c-0
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.007
You can go on the drop down box
and choose this if you don't

675b2dab-8060-40d4-98f3-f7ce9404677c-1
00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:03.880
have it already.

740c494e-65b5-46e4-a3c0-0294f79a5474-0
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.202
Our selection type is going to
be a new selection and now we

740c494e-65b5-46e4-a3c0-0294f79a5474-1
00:01:11.202 --> 00:01:15.280
need to add our clause for our
selection.

2d98de85-82ba-4723-946a-4bad312348a9-0
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.508
So this is different to the
Select by location tool as we're

2d98de85-82ba-4723-946a-4bad312348a9-1
00:01:21.508 --> 00:01:25.792
not selecting our data based on
the location of another layer,

2d98de85-82ba-4723-946a-4bad312348a9-2
00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:30.008
we're selecting our data based
on the attributes or the table

2d98de85-82ba-4723-946a-4bad312348a9-3
00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:32.320
information of that actual
layer.

88f7cec2-edd2-4a33-b9b9-d943d76390ec-0
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.179
So we need to hit the Add clause
button and in this box here we

88f7cec2-edd2-4a33-b9b9-d943d76390ec-1
00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:43.200
can choose what column in our
data layer we want to select by.

e77dbfe9-39e2-4b2e-972b-7e4b820a1bea-0
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.065
So we want to choose the
environment column we want it to

e77dbfe9-39e2-4b2e-972b-7e4b820a1bea-1
00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:48.440
be where it's equal to.

65feeea4-a866-48a9-a420-15a0c3596413-0
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.680
And now we can choose the type
of environment.

f6ec7603-9da5-4504-b9dc-727264f5eb26-0
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.411
So we'll start off choosing Farm
in this video and we can hit

f6ec7603-9da5-4504-b9dc-727264f5eb26-1
00:01:57.411 --> 00:01:57.920
apply.

1bae51f8-a470-4a8d-bd3d-f5c7e7d84285-0
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.290
And now this is going to select
our data based on all the points

1bae51f8-a470-4a8d-bd3d-f5c7e7d84285-1
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.200
that occurred within farm
environment.

51e35996-70a0-4c3c-a281-a5874d0e48cd-0
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.993
And now if we hit OK, we can see
on our map that the points that

51e35996-70a0-4c3c-a281-a5874d0e48cd-1
00:02:12.993 --> 00:02:16.476
occurred within farm have been
selected and they're

51e35996-70a0-4c3c-a281-a5874d0e48cd-2
00:02:16.476 --> 00:02:17.280
highlighted.

9f743797-274e-453b-9f02-f9015c2be247-0
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.640
So we can see which points there
they are.

c442fba1-053d-48d7-84e9-ed6f67a55f24-0
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.011
And now we can right click on
our points layer, open up the

c442fba1-053d-48d7-84e9-ed6f67a55f24-1
00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:29.942
attribute table and we can see
at the bottom here that ten of

c442fba1-053d-48d7-84e9-ed6f67a55f24-2
00:02:29.942 --> 00:02:33.760
our rows, ten of our points have
been selected.

4006684e-e1f2-4590-9e2c-92ff44d33240-0
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.692
We can click on the button with
the blue highlighted rows to see

4006684e-e1f2-4590-9e2c-92ff44d33240-1
00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:44.783
all the selected points and so
we know that 10 sighting points

4006684e-e1f2-4590-9e2c-92ff44d33240-2
00:02:44.783 --> 00:02:46.480
occurred in farmland.

74c07a0c-d4f6-4544-b01e-023ffbb2caa4-0
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.169
So now have a go at doing the
same for the other environment

74c07a0c-d4f6-4544-b01e-023ffbb2caa4-1
00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.920
types and writing down how many
occurred in each environment.
