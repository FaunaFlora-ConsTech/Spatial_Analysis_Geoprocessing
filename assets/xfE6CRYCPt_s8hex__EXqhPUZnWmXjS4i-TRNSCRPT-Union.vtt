00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.174
In this video we're using the
Union tool to create a union

69acbf00-c150-4c4c-bc76-d77c70f96d3a-1
00:00:05.174 --> 00:00:09.748
between our proposed No Take
layer and this fishing ground

69acbf00-c150-4c4c-bc76-d77c70f96d3a-2
00:00:09.748 --> 00:00:13.160
layer that you should have
hopefully added.

0b2b3e67-1fb5-4842-8adc-c86ba6058d00-0
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.386
So if we toggle this on and off
in our layers list, we can see

0b2b3e67-1fb5-4842-8adc-c86ba6058d00-1
00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:24.407
that it overlaps with the No
Take zone, and we're interested

0b2b3e67-1fb5-4842-8adc-c86ba6058d00-2
00:00:24.407 --> 00:00:29.347
in how much it overlaps by so
that we can work out how much

0b2b3e67-1fb5-4842-8adc-c86ba6058d00-3
00:00:29.347 --> 00:00:32.639
the fishing ground would be
reduced by.

d8359d8b-043a-4d73-8de9-ea225a438c3f-0
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.809
But for now, let's clean up our
layers list to begin with, so

d8359d8b-043a-4d73-8de9-ea225a438c3f-1
00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.920
this new no take layer.

abff3df5-92d4-4fae-adf9-4ee689723583-0
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.624
This was our old layer before we
ran the difference tool, so we

abff3df5-92d4-4fae-adf9-4ee689723583-1
00:00:46.624 --> 00:00:47.800
can remove this.

360b0a7b-411a-474d-995d-85315a83283f-0
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.542
We'll right click and choose
Remove Layer and now we can run

360b0a7b-411a-474d-995d-85315a83283f-1
00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:56.200
the Union tool.

3969cec0-ad10-4385-b5cf-aa2a61014e86-0
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.152
So the Union tool is different
to the Merge tool that we've

3969cec0-ad10-4385-b5cf-aa2a61014e86-1
00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:07.222
used before because although it
will join your layers together,

3969cec0-ad10-4385-b5cf-aa2a61014e86-2
00:01:07.222 --> 00:01:12.291
it will also create new polygons
in the new layer for where the

3969cec0-ad10-4385-b5cf-aa2a61014e86-3
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:13.480
layers overlap.

a5d59949-60b2-48fa-85a2-f32077735d69-0
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.869
And we're interested in where
these two layers overlap because

a5d59949-60b2-48fa-85a2-f32077735d69-1
00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.539
we want to find out how much the
fishing ground is going to be

a5d59949-60b2-48fa-85a2-f32077735d69-2
00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.135
reduced by if we kept this no
take zone as we can only reduce

a5d59949-60b2-48fa-85a2-f32077735d69-3
00:01:28.135 --> 00:01:29.839
it by a maximum of 25%.

37a38518-8630-46b9-9954-23c85f2bb318-0
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.289
So let's go ahead, type Union
into the toolbox and then click

37a38518-8630-46b9-9954-23c85f2bb318-1
00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.160
on the Union tool under Vector
Overlay.

df019625-ac9f-4dbe-8771-35bfd35afb38-0
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:46.630
Our input layer is going to be
the No take zone final and the

df019625-ac9f-4dbe-8771-35bfd35afb38-1
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.040
overlay layer will be the
fishing ground.

b9d7d783-3880-4ae4-ba1f-bfc1bfb8ea9b-0
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.813
And now we need to choose where
to save the new layer that's

b9d7d783-3880-4ae4-ba1f-bfc1bfb8ea9b-1
00:01:55.813 --> 00:01:56.880
going to be created.

29d79708-5962-4583-a023-bf7eae37f29d-0
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.028
And so as we've been doing,
we're going to save it to the

29d79708-5962-4583-a023-bf7eae37f29d-1
00:02:02.028 --> 00:02:03.880
Geo package we created.

a00b5118-4ac1-4f09-a853-db283ba046c7-0
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.240
So we'll double click here and
then name the new layer.

5df39d01-9a0d-4260-8940-c02f5cb89783-0
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.931
So we're going to name it
Fishing No Take Union, click OK

5df39d01-9a0d-4260-8940-c02f5cb89783-1
00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:18.080
and run the tool.

d54d6819-c555-4c69-bf6d-c86b66e3ec9c-0
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.813
And now if we toggle off the
original fishing ground and no

d54d6819-c555-4c69-bf6d-c86b66e3ec9c-1
00:02:24.813 --> 00:02:30.200
Take zone final layers, we can
see this new layer that's been

d54d6819-c555-4c69-bf6d-c86b66e3ec9c-2
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.501
created, the Union layer, and it
has joined these two layers

d54d6819-c555-4c69-bf6d-c86b66e3ec9c-3
00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:40.714
together and also kept the
boundaries between the layers as

d54d6819-c555-4c69-bf6d-c86b66e3ec9c-4
00:02:40.714 --> 00:02:42.799
well where they overlap.

8cb028e7-7782-4f16-9705-2c75bfb8c1c9-0
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.846
So let's open up the attribute
table for this union layer and

8cb028e7-7782-4f16-9705-2c75bfb8c1c9-1
00:02:47.846 --> 00:02:52.683
we can see there's three rows in
this table, so this represents

8cb028e7-7782-4f16-9705-2c75bfb8c1c9-2
00:02:52.683 --> 00:02:54.119
the three polygons.

a78e8c6e-486a-4da0-9993-c97f94939f56-0
00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.566
So the first Polygon is the
proposed no take zone minus the

a78e8c6e-486a-4da0-9993-c97f94939f56-1
00:03:00.566 --> 00:03:02.440
overlapping areas.

8001b6b5-3167-4425-8cfd-01d3dbcc53dc-0
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.689
The next Polygon is the fishing
ground and minus the overlapping

8001b6b5-3167-4425-8cfd-01d3dbcc53dc-1
00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:17.789
areas as well, and then the last
Polygon is the overlapping

8001b6b5-3167-4425-8cfd-01d3dbcc53dc-2
00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:18.400
areas.

c8ba2de7-96e2-4960-8a73-a9016dd88a42-0
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.354
And this is what we're
interested in because we want to

c8ba2de7-96e2-4960-8a73-a9016dd88a42-1
00:03:22.354 --> 00:03:26.520
know what is the total area of
these overlapping sections.

58645b3b-2d0f-4c9c-9c6d-5d80279c3689-0
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.143
So to work out the area, we need
to do as we did in the spatial

58645b3b-2d0f-4c9c-9c6d-5d80279c3689-1
00:03:32.143 --> 00:03:36.846
analysis area lesson, we need to
toggle the editing mode on our

58645b3b-2d0f-4c9c-9c6d-5d80279c3689-2
00:03:36.846 --> 00:03:41.476
table on and we need to create a
new field by clicking the New

58645b3b-2d0f-4c9c-9c6d-5d80279c3689-3
00:03:41.476 --> 00:03:43.239
Field button at the top.

2a6dc3bc-b47b-4f75-912a-467a68a0ad47-0
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.853
We're going to name it Area and
choose the type, it's decimal

2a6dc3bc-b47b-4f75-912a-467a68a0ad47-1
00:03:47.853 --> 00:03:49.920
number and then we'll click OK.

de021505-ea37-433d-b1ba-18cb1dc352f2-0
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.881
So if we scroll across we'll see
that we now have this column for

de021505-ea37-433d-b1ba-18cb1dc352f2-1
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:55.200
Area.

04c50d51-efd8-4673-ad14-d5f9d9c74288-0
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.466
So what we need to do, and what
we did before was we need to set

04c50d51-efd8-4673-ad14-d5f9d9c74288-1
00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:06.333
the units of our project so that
we know what units this area is

04c50d51-efd8-4673-ad14-d5f9d9c74288-2
00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:08.280
going to be calculated in.

1ccdd814-6e77-45cd-90b1-6277ef1bbe63-0
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.412
We'll do that by going into the
Project tab and going into

1ccdd814-6e77-45cd-90b1-6277ef1bbe63-1
00:04:13.412 --> 00:04:18.427
Properties and then in the
General tab, under Measurements,

1ccdd814-6e77-45cd-90b1-6277ef1bbe63-2
00:04:18.427 --> 00:04:23.359
we can choose the unit for area
and distance measurements.

d113a5f5-a198-4095-b8ff-8085afeea83f-0
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.316
So for area measurement we want
to change this to square

d113a5f5-a198-4095-b8ff-8085afeea83f-1
00:04:28.316 --> 00:04:33.360
kilometres and then we'll apply
our changes and click OK.

2a5816fa-18c0-48e2-84de-23ee55728d46-0
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:43.411
And now if we open our table
back up the attribute table, we

2a5816fa-18c0-48e2-84de-23ee55728d46-1
00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:49.590
can scroll across to see our
area column again.

cf80f0f3-dc04-455b-b8fe-6bcfb6d220e0-0
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.190
And now we're going to do the
calculation.

aa7e0f19-c00e-4fb5-800b-433d38ba1b29-0
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.837
So we'll click on this drop back
down box, make sure it says area

aa7e0f19-c00e-4fb5-800b-433d38ba1b29-1
00:04:56.837 --> 00:04:58.950
and then type in our equation.

e15178af-0a76-4e9e-8763-7e35070154b6-0
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:05.187
So it's $ area, update all and
now in our area column we can

e15178af-0a76-4e9e-8763-7e35070154b6-1
00:05:05.187 --> 00:05:11.322
see the areas of the three
polygons, the three feature rows

e15178af-0a76-4e9e-8763-7e35070154b6-2
00:05:11.322 --> 00:05:15.720
and so the one that we've got
highlighted.

55ac752d-3b7a-4203-a675-1d0e23363cec-0
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.920
This is the overlapping
sections.

00009eb8-8450-4320-8875-bcb1f75986ef-0
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.269
And so this is the area that we
wanted to know, so we know that

00009eb8-8450-4320-8875-bcb1f75986ef-1
00:05:22.269 --> 00:05:25.736
it's around 14 kilometres
squared, the overlapping

00009eb8-8450-4320-8875-bcb1f75986ef-2
00:05:25.736 --> 00:05:26.280
regions.

776bb0d1-6772-44dc-ac5d-19622e0e5f27-0
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.044
So we're going to save our edits
and toggle editing mode off now

776bb0d1-6772-44dc-ac5d-19622e0e5f27-1
00:05:32.044 --> 00:05:36.760
and we need to know the area of
the total fishing ground.

c7b39ed8-bba6-400f-9d8d-661835fd9429-0
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.800
So let's open up the attribute
table for the fishing ground.

d55f206b-0d28-4118-b710-6a395f64fc25-0
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.920
And we're going to do the same
process here.

c9b50109-76e6-4ec2-8a8b-a86e58be2ffd-0
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.000
So we'll toggle editing mode on.

c21cf622-801c-46c0-84cc-d6d266052a29-0
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.413
We're going to create a new
field, we'll name it Area and

c21cf622-801c-46c0-84cc-d6d266052a29-1
00:05:53.413 --> 00:06:00.739
again choose Decimal number and
click OK and now we'll choose

c21cf622-801c-46c0-84cc-d6d266052a29-2
00:06:00.739 --> 00:06:08.419
the column in this box and we'll
type in the equation, so $ area

c21cf622-801c-46c0-84cc-d6d266052a29-3
00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:15.627
and click update all and that
gives us the area of the total

c21cf622-801c-46c0-84cc-d6d266052a29-4
00:06:15.627 --> 00:06:17.400
fishing ground.

9533688e-bb0f-4f94-adb8-c3ed39c3904b-0
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.120
So now we just need to divide
the overlapping area by this

9533688e-bb0f-4f94-adb8-c3ed39c3904b-1
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.000
total area.

694bc58a-ab14-459c-8cfa-9b319710a7ef-0
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:31.852
So we'll get up the table for
the overlapping area, and if we

694bc58a-ab14-459c-8cfa-9b319710a7ef-1
00:06:31.852 --> 00:06:39.546
get up a calculator, we can type
in the area of the overlapping

694bc58a-ab14-459c-8cfa-9b319710a7ef-2
00:06:39.546 --> 00:06:46.518
areas divided by the total
fishing ground area times that

694bc58a-ab14-459c-8cfa-9b319710a7ef-3
00:06:46.518 --> 00:06:47.360
by 100.

d5ba7af8-9c8b-486b-8ae3-282d7340bfee-0
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.440
And we can see we've got 21% as
the answer.

7098eaa1-082a-4e30-a58b-c092b0f8b5a0-0
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.981
So the fishing ground would be
reduced by 21% and that's lower

7098eaa1-082a-4e30-a58b-c092b0f8b5a0-1
00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:04.434
than the 25% maximum and so we
can go ahead with this no take

7098eaa1-082a-4e30-a58b-c092b0f8b5a0-2
00:07:04.434 --> 00:07:09.360
zone and so that's how to run a
the union tool in QGIS.

40ff6c29-57f8-4ec3-af97-7712bd0f9df5-0
00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.920
So again, just hit save to save
your progress.
