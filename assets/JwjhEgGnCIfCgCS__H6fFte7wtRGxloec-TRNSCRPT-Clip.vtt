00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.145
Hopefully now you've been able
to set up this new project in

91f704d6-a13e-4ea8-928e-74fe1ffb7007-1
00:00:06.145 --> 00:00:10.429
Arc GIS Pro and you've set up a
folder connection to your

91f704d6-a13e-4ea8-928e-74fe1ffb7007-2
00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.935
downloaded materials and you've
added these four layers into

91f704d6-a13e-4ea8-928e-74fe1ffb7007-3
00:00:14.935 --> 00:00:15.600
your map.

efb65d2f-f4d5-4d57-a3e5-03d266f8e62d-0
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.080
So in our contents we can see
these four layers.

342bcd25-4f5c-422a-be59-b9bc034cfecf-0
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.018
The green polygons are the
spawning grounds of the grouper

342bcd25-4f5c-422a-be59-b9bc034cfecf-1
00:00:24.018 --> 00:00:24.400
fish.

ae1d6a89-de03-4153-bb75-78d78132eda0-0
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.384
We've got a pink Polygon
representing Tristina Island,

ae1d6a89-de03-4153-bb75-78d78132eda0-1
00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:35.674
and then we've got a blue
Polygon to show the current no

ae1d6a89-de03-4153-bb75-78d78132eda0-2
00:00:35.674 --> 00:00:39.480
take MPA zone that is around the
island.

0e53a24b-6ba6-409d-b5da-5797b9914f35-0
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.365
And we've also got a Polygon
that shows us the seas that are

0e53a24b-6ba6-409d-b5da-5797b9914f35-1
00:00:44.365 --> 00:00:47.800
owned by Tristina Island, the
territorial seas.

cf686103-013c-4294-ad3d-e99e0eb90454-0
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.941
So in this video, we're going to
be using the Clip geoprocessing

cf686103-013c-4294-ad3d-e99e0eb90454-1
00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:57.235
tool so that we can clip the
spawning grounds layer as we are

cf686103-013c-4294-ad3d-e99e0eb90454-2
00:00:57.235 --> 00:01:01.391
only interested in the spawning
grounds that are within the

cf686103-013c-4294-ad3d-e99e0eb90454-3
00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:03.400
territorial seas of Tristina.

859686ce-445f-4ca5-b903-cb26fc973fd6-0
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.400
So now we can open up our
geoprocessing toolbox.

1790aa21-bc04-4be6-a319-d39ca0b56cc0-0
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.368
So we'll go into the Analysis
tab, click on Tools, and now we

1790aa21-bc04-4be6-a319-d39ca0b56cc0-1
00:01:15.368 --> 00:01:22.336
can search in Clip and it's the
first one that comes up so we

1790aa21-bc04-4be6-a319-d39ca0b56cc0-2
00:01:22.336 --> 00:01:24.360
can click on this.

bd25322f-27fd-4f46-8961-69e25cf52071-0
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.210
So the first thing we need to
put in is our input feature.

99247e3c-7ae6-4b9d-bdc6-3445285b2194-0
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.325
This is going to be the spawning
grounds as this is the feature

99247e3c-7ae6-4b9d-bdc6-3445285b2194-1
00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:42.730
that we want to clip. 

720a0e92-6105-4e41-8639-aeb62ee4772f-0
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.991
And then the clip features, this
is going to be what layer we're

720a0e92-6105-4e41-8639-aeb62ee4772f-1
00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:50.925
using to show Arcgis Pro where
we want to clip the spawning

720a0e92-6105-4e41-8639-aeb62ee4772f-2
00:01:50.925 --> 00:01:51.450
data to.

02255451-1496-4652-9262-84fbf0f83f68-0
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.880
And so that's going to be the
territorial sea layer.

1a77c0d1-f9c6-4938-aca1-db2ce9726f3f-0
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.320
So we can drag this into the box
there.

be1220f0-cead-46c1-b55c-3cf563bfdbeb-0
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.244
And the last thing we need to
fill in is just where we want to

be1220f0-cead-46c1-b55c-3cf563bfdbeb-1
00:02:05.244 --> 00:02:06.160
save this new layer.

84dbc176-acb5-4cfb-ae36-46bd6e6685e0-0
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.351
Because as we know, a
Geoprocessing tool creates a new

84dbc176-acb5-4cfb-ae36-46bd6e6685e0-1
00:02:12.351 --> 00:02:17.080
layer with the manipulated data
in in it.

19c61c94-fce2-4acf-862c-a90603584480-0
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.881
 So we can save it in our
Geodatabase that was

19c61c94-fce2-4acf-862c-a90603584480-1
00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:23.756
automatically set up when we set
up this project and we can name

19c61c94-fce2-4acf-862c-a90603584480-2
00:02:23.756 --> 00:02:26.200
it something like Spawning
Grounds clip.

4b27cff4-8076-4fe2-9e33-dd0a49a45839-0
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.120
So we know it's the clipped data
set and then we can hit run.

a9d615fe-9df6-4fa7-a05f-463da59ac258-0
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.075
And now if we turn off the
original spawning grounds data

a9d615fe-9df6-4fa7-a05f-463da59ac258-1
00:02:44.075 --> 00:02:49.426
set, in the contents we can see
that our new layer is just the

a9d615fe-9df6-4fa7-a05f-463da59ac258-2
00:02:49.426 --> 00:02:54.351
spawning grounds that are
overlapping or occurring within

a9d615fe-9df6-4fa7-a05f-463da59ac258-3
00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:56.560
the territorial sea layer.

8610a706-7fdc-4198-9eb1-5fb9551a8e70-0
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.200
And so that's how to use the
Clip tool in Arcgis Pro.

d43a0f52-9295-4697-93e6-3b457ffa09ed-0
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.400
So just remember to hit save to
save your changes.
