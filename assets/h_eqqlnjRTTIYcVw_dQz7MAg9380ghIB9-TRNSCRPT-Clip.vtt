6524a7b0-e0fb-4a15-b55b-757932e570b8-0
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.957
Hopefully now you've been able
to set up this new project in

6524a7b0-e0fb-4a15-b55b-757932e570b8-1
00:00:06.957 --> 00:00:11.994
QGIS and you've navigated in
your browser window so that you

6524a7b0-e0fb-4a15-b55b-757932e570b8-2
00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:17.280
can add your materials from the
Geoprocessing Materials folder.

622c2ac5-9a4f-46af-9b28-6d7e371c4f53-0
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.607
So you should have added in
these four layers into your map

622c2ac5-9a4f-46af-9b28-6d7e371c4f53-1
00:00:22.607 --> 00:00:25.440
and you can see them on your
layers list.

3e597bb6-dbdc-4657-b7f0-1bb236b38882-0
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.092
So we've got these bluey grey
polygons that are representing

3e597bb6-dbdc-4657-b7f0-1bb236b38882-1
00:00:32.092 --> 00:00:35.880
the spawning grounds of the
group of fish.

33d2fe4a-152d-4556-80cc-910840ac9577-0
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.978
We've got a pink Polygon that
represents Tristina Island and

33d2fe4a-152d-4556-80cc-910840ac9577-1
00:00:47.978 --> 00:00:54.271
we've got a purple Polygon
around Tristina Island that

33d2fe4a-152d-4556-80cc-910840ac9577-2
00:00:54.271 --> 00:01:01.021
shows us the current no take
zone of the MPA that's around

33d2fe4a-152d-4556-80cc-910840ac9577-3
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:02.279
the island.

365f50f2-ae6c-4f6f-bf00-0ba52a3f8ece-0
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.831
And we've also got a Polygon
that's in blue showing us the

365f50f2-ae6c-4f6f-bf00-0ba52a3f8ece-1
00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:09.360
territorial seas of Tristina
Island.

cee4c6f0-27a4-401c-a1a3-46e8cb09d2c6-0
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.242
So in this video we're going to
be using the Clip geoprocessing

cee4c6f0-27a4-401c-a1a3-46e8cb09d2c6-1
00:01:15.242 --> 00:01:19.858
tool so that we can clip the
spawning grounds layer as we're

cee4c6f0-27a4-401c-a1a3-46e8cb09d2c6-2
00:01:19.858 --> 00:01:24.323
only interested in the spawning
grounds that are within or

cee4c6f0-27a4-401c-a1a3-46e8cb09d2c6-3
00:01:24.323 --> 00:01:27.879
intersecting the territorial
seas of Tristina.

a66b78d4-0919-44a2-9a94-bbae6696b3d6-0
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.556
So now let's open up the
Geoprocessing toolbox, go into

a66b78d4-0919-44a2-9a94-bbae6696b3d6-1
00:01:35.556 --> 00:01:42.392
the Processing tab and click on
Toolbox and then within this

a66b78d4-0919-44a2-9a94-bbae6696b3d6-2
00:01:42.392 --> 00:01:48.781
window search clip into the
search bar and then it's the

a66b78d4-0919-44a2-9a94-bbae6696b3d6-3
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:53.040
first tool at the top, the Clip
tool.

e4dd7a4b-0c19-41e1-9e07-e2c6bd36c4c7-0
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.512
So click on this to open it and
the clip tool is really simple

e4dd7a4b-0c19-41e1-9e07-e2c6bd36c4c7-1
00:01:58.512 --> 00:01:59.120
to run.

b718f4df-0206-4141-98ee-30e02d9fbe36-0
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.520
We just need our input layer and
an overlay layer.

486c3bcf-9756-4d9c-bb1d-bbaab4d3dd4e-0
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.371
So the input layer is which
layer we are clipping and so

486c3bcf-9756-4d9c-bb1d-bbaab4d3dd4e-1
00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:10.200
that's going to be the spawning
grounds.

b92b2f4a-1e0b-4ad0-83d1-4642df0b4bd0-0
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.501
So you can click on the drop
down box and choose the spawning

b92b2f4a-1e0b-4ad0-83d1-4642df0b4bd0-1
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:19.960
grounds layer and then for the
overlay layer.

69ba76bf-e104-4732-9535-c2386b921479-0
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.925
This is what layer we're going
to use to tell QGIS where to

69ba76bf-e104-4732-9535-c2386b921479-1
00:02:24.925 --> 00:02:27.760
clip the spawning grounds layer
to.

fca7f8a0-aebe-44c9-8a17-9223e4d99ead-0
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.992
So this is going to be the
territorial seas Polygon layer

fca7f8a0-aebe-44c9-8a17-9223e4d99ead-1
00:02:32.992 --> 00:02:37.719
as we're only interested in the
spawnings that are within this

fca7f8a0-aebe-44c9-8a17-9223e4d99ead-2
00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.520
territorial sea Polygon.

f03b0cfa-13fb-4f8e-becb-a559ce91a437-0
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.064
And now we just need to choose
where to save the new layer that

f03b0cfa-13fb-4f8e-becb-a559ce91a437-1
00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:46.160
this tool is going to create
too.

2a7751a0-16e0-466d-b17c-e55be71b8c71-0
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.376
We'll choose, we'll click on the
three dots and click save to Geo

2a7751a0-16e0-466d-b17c-e55be71b8c71-1
00:02:50.376 --> 00:02:50.800
package.

1aca6211-7816-40bb-b1cc-d71e006dc2ed-0
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.385
And now we want to go into the
folder Tristina Island MPA that

1aca6211-7816-40bb-b1cc-d71e006dc2ed-1
00:02:57.385 --> 00:02:58.200
we created.

face1944-3181-4769-b7e1-f50fb8790b2e-0
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.757
And now we're going to choose
what to name the Geo package

face1944-3181-4769-b7e1-f50fb8790b2e-1
00:03:01.757 --> 00:03:04.400
that we're setting up as we
haven't set one up yet.

4b8be535-932e-422f-87f0-78b9bb1826f4-0
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.595
So we'll just call it the same
name as the project Tristina

4b8be535-932e-422f-87f0-78b9bb1826f4-1
00:03:08.595 --> 00:03:09.240
Island MPA.

5efb9422-8d8f-4d82-949c-af2dd33b1e03-0
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.195
Click save and now we can choose
the name of the new layer that

5efb9422-8d8f-4d82-949c-af2dd33b1e03-1
00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:15.720
we're going to create.

c3bc5341-f673-4612-ab40-56f89376566c-0
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:32.540
So we can call this spawning
clipped and click OK and then

c3bc5341-f673-4612-ab40-56f89376566c-1
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.070
run the tool.

6c9b6afe-4d17-4f7f-a18e-125e9642d1d5-0
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.713
And so now we see that this
layer has come up in our layers

6c9b6afe-4d17-4f7f-a18e-125e9642d1d5-1
00:03:42.713 --> 00:03:43.030
list.

6dfbec0f-0edf-47ec-b8de-f90042abf40a-0
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.273
Let's toggle off the original
spawning grounds layer and there

6dfbec0f-0edf-47ec-b8de-f90042abf40a-1
00:03:48.273 --> 00:03:48.750
we go.

eb14a208-b086-4487-96c2-ebc2f9d538c7-0
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.211
We can see that QGIS has clipped
the spawning grounds layer,

eb14a208-b086-4487-96c2-ebc2f9d538c7-1
00:03:54.211 --> 00:03:59.940
created the new layer with this
clip data in it and we can just

eb14a208-b086-4487-96c2-ebc2f9d538c7-2
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.954
right click on Tristina
territorial seas layer and zoom

eb14a208-b086-4487-96c2-ebc2f9d538c7-3
00:04:04.954 --> 00:04:05.760
to layer.

b5136287-232f-4203-954a-dcbacecce6b4-0
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.960
And that's how to run the clip
tool in QGIS.

2c783d58-0a7a-4a03-982b-fbf3b6c0e73b-0
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.640
So just remember to hit save to
save your progress.
