00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.405
In this video, we're going to be
using the buffer tool to create

aba09894-5b58-472a-82e2-a746448c839b-1
00:00:08.405 --> 00:00:14.400
a buffer zone of 1 kilometre
around the oil rig near our MPA.

2230ef71-9010-49c1-b95e-465a74f12416-0
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.537
So first of all, let's just
remove some of these layers in

2230ef71-9010-49c1-b95e-465a74f12416-1
00:00:18.537 --> 00:00:20.600
our contents that we don't need
any more.

3a378bd9-0115-4c38-ae52-f8e8b821c7bd-0
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.143
So we'll keep the dissolved
layer that we created and we'll

3a378bd9-0115-4c38-ae52-f8e8b821c7bd-1
00:00:26.143 --> 00:00:29.440
remove the other spawning ground
layers.

9ae7c1e0-32cc-4c0a-9a24-6676d056652b-0
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.080
And now let's run the buffer
tool.

dccc673a-0468-4f76-a150-c7d835ead12d-0
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:42.318
So we're going to go into the
geoprocessing window and search

dccc673a-0468-4f76-a150-c7d835ead12d-1
00:00:42.318 --> 00:00:48.040
in buffer and it's the first
tool that comes up.

9ca7d9e2-8088-49ca-acf1-a8ee23a23761-0
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.600
And let's put in the parameters
for this tool.

2518ccef-f3b5-4428-adf1-f138c6cf2656-0
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.580
So our input feature is the oil
rig as this is the layer that we

2518ccef-f3b5-4428-adf1-f138c6cf2656-1
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.160
want to create the buffer zone
around.

454cb5ea-9a10-4a4b-bcef-f58600017864-0
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.664
And now we need to choose where
we want to save the new buffer

454cb5ea-9a10-4a4b-bcef-f58600017864-1
00:01:07.664 --> 00:01:10.160
layer to and what we're going to
name it.

f965817a-efb7-4f1c-a8bd-1813e53081e2-0
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.416
So let's make sure it's going
into our Geodatabase and we'll

f965817a-efb7-4f1c-a8bd-1813e53081e2-1
00:01:17.416 --> 00:01:19.640
name it oil rig buffer.

4bb652ee-ca8f-47d5-adfe-73034fbbc64d-0
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.360
And now the distance.

cfcfc10d-258d-42b8-b8a6-a52c326f78bf-0
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.417
We're creating a buffer zone of
1 kilometre, so we can put one

cfcfc10d-258d-42b8-b8a6-a52c326f78bf-1
00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:32.760
in this first box.

55578690-f37f-423a-9a94-46def2f386ab-0
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.365
And we're going to choose the
linear unit option as we are

55578690-f37f-423a-9a94-46def2f386ab-1
00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:39.800
measuring in kilometres.

9276a9c3-17e5-4104-965b-4606d131303d-0
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.960


531913d0-89ae-4e68-bc3a-8263f8e578b6-0
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.607
But we could choose field if our
layer had a column in its table

531913d0-89ae-4e68-bc3a-8263f8e578b6-1
00:01:45.607 --> 00:01:49.540
that specified the buffer
distance. And now we want to

531913d0-89ae-4e68-bc3a-8263f8e578b6-2
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.258
choose the units to be
kilometres, the side type we

531913d0-89ae-4e68-bc3a-8263f8e578b6-3
00:01:53.258 --> 00:01:57.762
could choose full, which would
mean that the buffer zone would

531913d0-89ae-4e68-bc3a-8263f8e578b6-4
00:01:57.762 --> 00:02:02.124
include the area of the feature
being buffered, or the other

531913d0-89ae-4e68-bc3a-8263f8e578b6-5
00:02:02.124 --> 00:02:06.200
option which excludes the input
Polygon from the buffer.

bfe4b977-81a3-489e-bf50-5f7583d68529-0
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.086
It doesn't really matter for
what we're doing as we're just

bfe4b977-81a3-489e-bf50-5f7583d68529-1
00:02:10.086 --> 00:02:13.589
using this to see whether the
buffer zone would overlap, but

bfe4b977-81a3-489e-bf50-5f7583d68529-2
00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.599
we'll just use the exclude
option.

acece94b-645c-431c-9694-5965f7692403-0
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.760
The method planar measures
distance in on a 2D plane,

acece94b-645c-431c-9694-5965f7692403-1
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.240
whereas geodesic will account
for the shape of the earth.

a0c64f3e-9457-44e8-aa33-0fc0d18c6c09-0
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.706
So you should use geodesic if
your data is covering multiple

a0c64f3e-9457-44e8-aa33-0fc0d18c6c09-1
00:02:28.706 --> 00:02:32.600
UTM zones or your projection may
distort area or distance.

b73e9687-a202-43bd-a0a6-9b562b8db079-0
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.700
But since we're using a singular
UTM zone that's minimising

b73e9687-a202-43bd-a0a6-9b562b8db079-1
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.585
distortion, we can choose the
Planar option and the dissolve

b73e9687-a202-43bd-a0a6-9b562b8db079-2
00:02:40.585 --> 00:02:44.533
type just allows us to choose
whether we want to dissolve any

b73e9687-a202-43bd-a0a6-9b562b8db079-3
00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:45.680
of the boundaries.

6ac9dd58-78d8-4d3a-88bc-08164fff4427-0
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.390
But we can just leave this as no
dissolve and run the tool and

6ac9dd58-78d8-4d3a-88bc-08164fff4427-1
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.920
now we can see our new layer on
our map and in our contents.

04d2779a-96f1-4f6e-976f-68ff0958e778-0
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.524
So we have a 1 kilometer buffer
zone around the location of the

04d2779a-96f1-4f6e-976f-68ff0958e778-1
00:03:01.524 --> 00:03:06.230
oil rig, and we can zoom to this
layer by right clicking on it in

04d2779a-96f1-4f6e-976f-68ff0958e778-2
00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.440
the contents and clicking the
zoom to layer.

ea0eedbb-6214-4da4-8db1-bebaccd4c7fa-0
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.658
And we can see that it's buffer
zone does overlap with the no

ea0eedbb-6214-4da4-8db1-bebaccd4c7fa-1
00:03:13.658 --> 00:03:17.000
take zone that we're proposing
for the spawning months.

0256bbdb-eac8-4adf-a84e-e1c69b4bb935-0
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.720
So we'll need to remove this
area of the no take zone.

525da574-7777-4eb3-90e8-711703a7b31c-0
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.080
So just remember to hit save to
save your progress.
