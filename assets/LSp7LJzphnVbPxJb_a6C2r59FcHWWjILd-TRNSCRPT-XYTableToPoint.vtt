3202ca41-42cd-410f-9d1f-d3570cb43e2c-0
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.569
So we have our data in our
table, but we want to see our

3202ca41-42cd-410f-9d1f-d3570cb43e2c-1
00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.733
sighting locations on our map,
and so to do that we're going to

3202ca41-42cd-410f-9d1f-d3570cb43e2c-2
00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:10.969
need to use a tool.

20ed5c5d-7c75-411f-963f-fc34693291db-0
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.960
We can shut this table

16166437-977f-4cca-b1d9-9fdb4e3d22f7-0
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.910
and go into the processing tab

e913d2a5-7fef-41e4-a2e9-888f09fc11ba-0
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.740
and open up the toolbox

85f42d65-fe06-482c-859d-705a37a2f25b-0
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.639
and now we're in the processing
toolbox. We can search in the

85f42d65-fe06-482c-859d-705a37a2f25b-1
00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:31.229
tool that we need and we need
create points layer from table.

85f42d65-fe06-482c-859d-705a37a2f25b-2
00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:32.340
So type that in

2cf3d9eb-eadd-46b5-aefd-74175965e0a8-0
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.960
and once it comes up you can
double click on it

9cb46df6-ffe9-4d64-a519-14490ee0cb4e-0
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.460
to bring up the tool window

a3848781-4273-4a4a-a3c5-6762cd0bad73-0
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.640
and so to run the tool we need
to put in the parameters

877943b7-3292-4363-9b2c-e1a4a79f4d9a-0
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.832
so the input layer QGIS has put
this in for us. It's our

877943b7-3292-4363-9b2c-e1a4a79f4d9a-1
00:00:52.832 --> 00:00:54.790
Hippogriff sightings table

ac877dc4-8575-4167-b3ba-257a0441e826-0
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.812
and now we need to put in the X
field and the Y field so when we

ac877dc4-8575-4167-b3ba-257a0441e826-1
00:00:59.812 --> 00:01:03.801
click on the drop down box we
can choose from the different

ac877dc4-8575-4167-b3ba-257a0441e826-2
00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:07.060
column headings which one
represents the X field

d3058730-0892-4da7-938a-496189429e51-0
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.080
and the X field is longitude.
And the Y field is latitude.

78b15966-4fdf-424b-9425-5b2639ca8bca-0
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.353
And a good way to remember this
is to think that you walk along

78b15966-4fdf-424b-9425-5b2639ca8bca-1
00:01:15.353 --> 00:01:17.060
the corridor and up the stairs.

e21f6bd2-1df1-4f27-bc6a-51ce450bf208-0
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.885
We don't need to worry about Z
Field or M Field as we don't

e21f6bd2-1df1-4f27-bc6a-51ce450bf208-1
00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:23.120
have these in our data

e85fae9c-1f27-4e77-b6ce-da285805ad08-0
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.926
and so the last thing to choose
is our coordinate reference

e85fae9c-1f27-4e77-b6ce-da285805ad08-1
00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:28.390
system.

a4edf5d8-be78-4341-b55a-9f69e933e467-0
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.012
So this is the reference system
that the points were collected

a4edf5d8-be78-4341-b55a-9f69e933e467-1
00:01:33.012 --> 00:01:36.685
in and they were collected in
the geographic coordinate system

a4edf5d8-be78-4341-b55a-9f69e933e467-2
00:01:36.685 --> 00:01:40.358
WGS 1984. So to set this we need
to click on the little button

a4edf5d8-be78-4341-b55a-9f69e933e467-3
00:01:40.358 --> 00:01:41.350
here on the right

4ed24b9e-3bb6-40a3-abdf-f334ff367f27-0
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.620
and we could type in the search
bar WGS 84

85fa3ac6-2d43-4e17-b13d-898aaf6d1f0c-0
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.253
to try and look for this
coordinate system. But we can

85fa3ac6-2d43-4e17-b13d-898aaf6d1f0c-1
00:01:50.253 --> 00:01:53.131
see that it gives us lots of
different choices, and it's a

85fa3ac6-2d43-4e17-b13d-898aaf6d1f0c-2
00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:56.010
bit confusing which one is the
one that we're looking for.

ab1c2b95-34eb-4215-be8e-b7c811207efb-0
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.681
So what we can do instead is
type in the WKID number of the

ab1c2b95-34eb-4215-be8e-b7c811207efb-1
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:05.990
coordinate system, or the ID
number, which is 4326,

7c786ece-54dd-40c2-9d58-bf495ea1df40-0
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.565
and we can see that we've got
it. Here it's WGS 84. So we can

7c786ece-54dd-40c2-9d58-bf495ea1df40-1
00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:14.730
click on this, click OK and now
we can hit run

72e2af88-aec3-4a89-a100-23d01dbf3af0-0
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.160
and that's gonna run out all.

8cc8b2b6-2b7d-4466-bdd4-b38cbb819329-0
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.417
So it ran really quickly. We
just need to shut the table now.

8cc8b2b6-2b7d-4466-bdd4-b38cbb819329-1
00:02:23.417 --> 00:02:25.970
And now on our map we can see
our points,

093cae67-6843-4a0d-8886-b8502d349862-0
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.575
so we just need to right click
on the points in the layers and

093cae67-6843-4a0d-8886-b8502d349862-1
00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:33.896
click zoom to layer to see them
all and there we go. We've

093cae67-6843-4a0d-8886-b8502d349862-2
00:02:33.896 --> 00:02:36.879
successfully plotted the
sighting locations from the

093cae67-6843-4a0d-8886-b8502d349862-3
00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.300
Excel table, so just remember to
hit save.
