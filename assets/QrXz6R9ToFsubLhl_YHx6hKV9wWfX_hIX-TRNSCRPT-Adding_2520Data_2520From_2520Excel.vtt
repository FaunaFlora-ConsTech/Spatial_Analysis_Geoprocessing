00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.289
At this point you should have
opened up your Arcgis Pro

5c4da286-85d2-4b0c-8731-e094f24d176f-1
00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:10.840
project, named it something like
Hippogriff Project and be

5c4da286-85d2-4b0c-8731-e094f24d176f-2
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.540
looking at a page similar to
this.

961f9fe8-9feb-42fb-8f72-2ddc286272a0-0
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.728
Now we're going to add in our
Excel data and so to do that

961f9fe8-9feb-42fb-8f72-2ddc286272a0-1
00:00:18.728 --> 00:00:23.453
we'll set up a folder connection
in the catalog pane here on the

961f9fe8-9feb-42fb-8f72-2ddc286272a0-2
00:00:23.453 --> 00:00:23.890
right.

da61a6e3-5aec-4e30-8cb2-ac925aa2264e-0
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.826
If you don't have your catalog
pane up, you just need to go

da61a6e3-5aec-4e30-8cb2-ac925aa2264e-1
00:00:28.826 --> 00:00:29.970
into the View tab

82c95841-b97a-47fe-b2a4-3e4f232662c7-0
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.730
and click on where it says
Catalog Pane

ee68d274-07c8-429a-ae32-2c4e8bc45369-0
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.517
and now we'll go into the
Catalog pane where it says

ee68d274-07c8-429a-ae32-2c4e8bc45369-1
00:00:41.517 --> 00:00:43.200
Folders, right click

619bc57a-2c89-438a-9550-15f1a70333f0-0
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.410
and click Add Folder Connection.

5cf2a70f-a500-439d-9634-8ded56d08363-0
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.154
In this window we're going to
navigate to our Materials folder

5cf2a70f-a500-439d-9634-8ded56d08363-1
00:00:56.154 --> 00:00:59.110
in our Hippogriff folder that we
created.

382a5d05-9341-4494-ae65-982b1349f421-0
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.220
So find where this is

36ad86d0-0e7d-4ec3-be06-d30f663e3a7d-0
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.597
and once you can see your
materials folder, click on it

36ad86d0-0e7d-4ec3-be06-d30f663e3a7d-1
00:01:15.597 --> 00:01:18.310
but don't go into it and click
OK

3ecde7ea-913c-4eed-986c-1cc4380e3c9f-0
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.850
and now we can see our Materials
folder in our catalog pane

f49899f8-55b9-46db-a6bc-5f1dc20f8b4d-0
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.660
so we can expand this

1418b44d-ce11-4ffa-8176-c733057a153d-0
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.000
and we'll see our Hippogriff
Excel workbook.

987c86cc-6131-4a0d-b840-4325b73e71c6-0
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.560
We can't add a whole Excel
workbook into our project,

103f969c-bc9a-4483-97ac-160343688268-0
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.520
so we'll need to expand this to
access the individual sheets.

c0180360-f4cd-418e-9283-82c2f01b54e7-0
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.930
So expand this

45495f4f-5902-4325-8c46-cacf95d95b31-0
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.281
and it might take a while to
load. If it doesn't work and you

45495f4f-5902-4325-8c46-cacf95d95b31-1
00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:58.288
get a message like 'required
driver is not installed', you

45495f4f-5902-4325-8c46-cacf95d95b31-2
00:01:58.288 --> 00:02:02.160
need to download a specific
Microsoft engine driver. The

45495f4f-5902-4325-8c46-cacf95d95b31-3
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.100
instructions for how to do this
will be below this video.

fb928096-f781-49fe-8714-85801629a9d6-0
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.340
Once you can see your table
sheet,

3ee927eb-099b-42ef-82ef-fc60acf0fa1b-0
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.860
you can click on it and drag it
across into your contents

a94a087b-bba6-4c33-9f5d-417e3f55b917-0
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.036
and now it's in your contents.
We can open it up and have a

a94a087b-bba6-4c33-9f5d-417e3f55b917-1
00:02:23.036 --> 00:02:27.400
look at the data inside. So
right click on it and click

a94a087b-bba6-4c33-9f5d-417e3f55b917-2
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.790
open.

7e1c2e79-8f95-4b94-abbc-bf979fed4288-0
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.486
The first column we have in our
table is the OID. This is the

7e1c2e79-8f95-4b94-abbc-bf979fed4288-1
00:02:37.486 --> 00:02:38.470
object ID,

2e477128-4354-43a0-9cba-4cb93f24a04a-0
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.700
so we have a different number
for each row.

b27578ab-4678-4dac-9a63-879f46b307c8-0
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.075
We have the unique key as well
and so these are the numbers of

b27578ab-4678-4dac-9a63-879f46b307c8-1
00:02:50.075 --> 00:02:55.130
the different GPS points. And
again, we have one for each row.

ca7db49b-7085-40c3-ae1d-58aad16d1076-0
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.030
We have the date that the
sighting happened.

1ebf2721-12ce-441b-8c04-6d0cb25a582d-0
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.497
We have the longitude and
latitude of the sighting. So

1ebf2721-12ce-441b-8c04-6d0cb25a582d-1
00:03:05.497 --> 00:03:07.280
where was it located?

2ecf80aa-62dd-411b-9a1b-04ef6df1d5c8-0
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.520
And we have what type of
sighting it was.

2e5213bd-f41d-4737-8a13-3c2ae21bad11-0
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.980
And so some of the sightings
were from tracks, from

2e5213bd-f41d-4737-8a13-3c2ae21bad11-1
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.660
footprints, from remaining food
and so on.

b07e55d9-1ab3-4050-8850-27c9863ac2a3-0
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.386
And then these last columns,
Arcgis Pro has automatically put

b07e55d9-1ab3-4050-8850-27c9863ac2a3-1
00:03:27.386 --> 00:03:29.680
them in and we don't need them,

737f0ac4-9350-4475-bcef-078da5a24895-0
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.522
so we can just click on all of
them and hide them. To do that,

737f0ac4-9350-4475-bcef-078da5a24895-1
00:03:34.522 --> 00:03:36.220
just click on one of them,

31666263-760a-451d-b718-9ea65fa2266c-0
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.105
hold down your control button
and click on the rest that we

31666263-760a-451d-b718-9ea65fa2266c-1
00:03:42.105 --> 00:03:42.950
don't need.

6bbb57a2-1410-47d8-9993-736f1e29f5db-0
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.080
Now you can right click

1c4e8076-182d-4c0b-bfdb-6c213ddf1880-0
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.100
and click hide field.
