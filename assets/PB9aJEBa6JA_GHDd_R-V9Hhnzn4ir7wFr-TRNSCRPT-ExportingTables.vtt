b8a390df-fdca-4981-a48f-0179b3486dbb-0
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.062
So the protected area
authorities also requested for

b8a390df-fdca-4981-a48f-0179b3486dbb-1
00:00:05.062 --> 00:00:07.360
the data to be shared as a
table.

45b02b80-57e9-4a6c-857a-ac6d64c70ae3-0
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.361
And so in this video we're going
to see how to export a layer as

45b02b80-57e9-4a6c-857a-ac6d64c70ae3-1
00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:14.760
a table in QGIS.

ce6df43a-e1a7-4792-8843-01d94b81be3f-0
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.720
So it's going to be a very
similar process to before.

4b9628f7-f278-4a7a-81ef-e7e6f2681faf-0
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.672
We'll make sure we're in our
Hippogriffs Ziama Sightings

4b9628f7-f278-4a7a-81ef-e7e6f2681faf-1
00:00:24.672 --> 00:00:25.160
layer.

dbd0adfd-03d8-4f7a-856f-2288f43a4dad-0
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.315
We're going to right click on
this, click Export and go Save

dbd0adfd-03d8-4f7a-856f-2288f43a4dad-1
00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:34.992
Features as and now the way to
change this to save it as a

dbd0adfd-03d8-4f7a-856f-2288f43a4dad-2
00:00:34.992 --> 00:00:39.511
table is by changing the format
and so these are all the

dbd0adfd-03d8-4f7a-856f-2288f43a4dad-3
00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:42.920
different things that we could
save it as.

c72b5f7e-6e7d-44b2-b231-59a8447eabfb-0
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.120
So there's lots of options for
exporting your layers in QGIS.

f53f98f6-4be7-440e-b692-eb126f5940db-0
00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.351
We're going to choose CSV as
this is going to export it as a

f53f98f6-4be7-440e-b692-eb126f5940db-1
00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:57.711
table and now we're going to
click on these three dots here

f53f98f6-4be7-440e-b692-eb126f5940db-2
00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:02.215
and we're going to save it in
the Ziama protected area folder

f53f98f6-4be7-440e-b692-eb126f5940db-3
00:01:02.215 --> 00:01:03.160
that we have.

a92f9703-215e-41b2-9df2-1dddf2589098-0
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:12.897
So we'll click and go into this
and we can name it Hippogriff or

a92f9703-215e-41b2-9df2-1dddf2589098-1
00:01:12.897 --> 00:01:18.440
we'll name it Sightings Ziama
table.

2e20c8dd-79c0-4532-8739-9efefcdb64a4-0
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.811
So it's nice and clear what it
is and hit OK, so we can see

2e20c8dd-79c0-4532-8739-9efefcdb64a4-1
00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:29.182
that's come up in our layers
list here, but it's also going

2e20c8dd-79c0-4532-8739-9efefcdb64a4-2
00:01:29.182 --> 00:01:33.480
to be saved within that folder
that we created.

2f572bf8-c571-4635-9e45-b9b9cf6de59c-0
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.021
So now we're going to open up
our computers File Explorer or

2f572bf8-c571-4635-9e45-b9b9cf6de59c-1
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:46.364
the the Finder application and
we're going to navigate to this

2f572bf8-c571-4635-9e45-b9b9cf6de59c-2
00:01:46.364 --> 00:01:48.680
folder that we created.

7d2f4f31-9754-43c3-8e9c-6447edaaeec8-0
00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.302
So here is Ziama PA. So if we
open it up, we've got our

7d2f4f31-9754-43c3-8e9c-6447edaaeec8-1
00:02:00.302 --> 00:02:04.560
sightings table and we've got
our shape file.

87380470-f6da-4022-8878-d5a3bd5716ea-0
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.366
Hopefully you can remember that
shapefiles are actually multiple

87380470-f6da-4022-8878-d5a3bd5716ea-1
00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:10.840
files.

f9cdb30d-503b-4196-9f1b-270bfd34174f-0
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.320
So here we've got five different
files for our shape file.

2adada0a-06fc-410c-93bb-262714bf6c2b-0
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.773
And so this is why it's really
good practice to put all of your

2adada0a-06fc-410c-93bb-262714bf6c2b-1
00:02:21.773 --> 00:02:26.987
materials for one project into a
folder and then you can zip up

2adada0a-06fc-410c-93bb-262714bf6c2b-2
00:02:26.987 --> 00:02:29.919
that folder and send it to
someone.

b0e03b6e-5658-4371-a90f-db7af5000e7e-0
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.120
So for this Ziama protected area

bbc3db8a-f3eb-43d5-aa9f-083bcce70454-0
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.175
we can zip up these materials in
a folder, e-mail it to someone,

bbc3db8a-f3eb-43d5-aa9f-083bcce70454-1
00:02:37.175 --> 00:02:39.920
and then they have all the
materials there.

c279e612-35c2-4b44-9928-591497cc0691-0
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.680
They can unzip it and work with
it within their GIS software.

e427f05d-0a8b-442c-aad3-35e82f2fd0db-0
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.762
So to do that, we're going to
just go back one stage so we can

e427f05d-0a8b-442c-aad3-35e82f2fd0db-1
00:02:49.762 --> 00:02:51.840
see our protected area folder.

94e81976-0818-4e6c-92d9-836ab9f9c6f6-0
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.794
We're going to right click on it
and we're going to hover over

94e81976-0818-4e6c-92d9-836ab9f9c6f6-1
00:02:58.794 --> 00:03:04.418
where it says send to and we'll
choose a compressed or zipped

94e81976-0818-4e6c-92d9-836ab9f9c6f6-2
00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:09.680
folder and there we go, that's
created our zipped folder.

c109cad7-c1ed-456b-ae8f-e5a95a546223-0
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.194
So now we could send that to
Ziama protected area and they

c109cad7-c1ed-456b-ae8f-e5a95a546223-1
00:03:13.194 --> 00:03:15.280
can access the materials in
there.

1d47e0dd-e258-415f-b712-7aa9a5fd95a5-0
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.511
So now have a go at doing the
same for Wonegizi and Wologizi,

1d47e0dd-e258-415f-b712-7aa9a5fd95a5-1
00:03:20.511 --> 00:03:24.613
putting the table within the
folders you created for those

1d47e0dd-e258-415f-b712-7aa9a5fd95a5-2
00:03:24.613 --> 00:03:28.160
protected areas and then zipping
up those folders.
