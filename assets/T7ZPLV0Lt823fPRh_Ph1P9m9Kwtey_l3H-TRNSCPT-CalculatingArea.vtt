f327ac18-e54d-4592-8e7a-df18704b6f71-0
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.949
So when we calculate the
geometry of a data layer, for

f327ac18-e54d-4592-8e7a-df18704b6f71-1
00:00:05.949 --> 00:00:10.773
example the length or the area,
we use that layers attribute

f327ac18-e54d-4592-8e7a-df18704b6f71-2
00:00:10.773 --> 00:00:11.959
table to do so.

1cb0b203-e916-4142-837a-3a41b382f15c-0
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.350
So we're going to start off by
calculating the area of the

1cb0b203-e916-4142-837a-3a41b382f15c-1
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.600
Ziama protected area.

4b82e9b3-a988-4666-91f7-6242209fe15e-0
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.680
So let's open up the attribute
table for this layer.

c478727e-9c6c-4649-8abe-6d8a042eca8b-0
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.546
And we need to create a new
column for Area so that we can

c478727e-9c6c-4649-8abe-6d8a042eca8b-1
00:00:31.546 --> 00:00:34.000
perform the geometry
calculation.

ac0840ee-f0c2-4d89-af8d-b670479c73da-0
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.110
So to do that we need to click
Add at the top of the table and

ac0840ee-f0c2-4d89-af8d-b670479c73da-1
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:47.359
this will bring up another table
window, which can look a bit

ac0840ee-f0c2-4d89-af8d-b670479c73da-2
00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:53.810
confusing, but we're going to go
over what each section is for.

a94822cc-efe4-4466-bbb7-14c17f36fd8d-0
00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.277
So the new column that we've
just added is on the bottom row

a94822cc-efe4-4466-bbb7-14c17f36fd8d-1
00:01:00.277 --> 00:01:05.280
here, and now we can set the
options for this new row.

98d4b5fd-5152-47d6-a90a-e1994cf211cb-0
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.749
So we're going to leave the
visible toggle box ticked on so

98d4b5fd-5152-47d6-a90a-e1994cf211cb-1
00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:11.000
that we can see it.

e876892c-8464-4b81-80c8-f3582010cf2d-0
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.568
We don't need to turn read only
on so we'll leave this how it is

e876892c-8464-4b81-80c8-f3582010cf2d-1
00:01:21.568 --> 00:01:27.041
and then in field name we can
set the name of the column in

e876892c-8464-4b81-80c8-f3582010cf2d-2
00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:32.696
here so we can just call it area
by double clicking on it and

e876892c-8464-4b81-80c8-f3582010cf2d-3
00:01:32.696 --> 00:01:38.443
typing area and then the alias
is an optional section and it's

e876892c-8464-4b81-80c8-f3582010cf2d-4
00:01:38.443 --> 00:01:43.642
just if you want to set a more
easy to understand column

e876892c-8464-4b81-80c8-f3582010cf2d-5
00:01:43.642 --> 00:01:49.480
heading for that field so we can
just put area in this as well.

b39a74d8-60cf-4fba-995d-b4165817fa51-0
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.895
And then for data type, if we
click on this, we can see the

b39a74d8-60cf-4fba-995d-b4165817fa51-1
00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:56.040
different options.

d2310ef3-41b3-4faa-8621-05035ec8c955-0
00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.197
So we're going to choose double
as this allows for numbers with

d2310ef3-41b3-4faa-8621-05035ec8c955-1
00:02:00.197 --> 00:02:03.660
decimal points and we want an
accurate number for the area, so

d2310ef3-41b3-4faa-8621-05035ec8c955-2
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.759
we'll choose double.

6852c865-f9ac-4b32-8562-2a25b0fabaaf-0
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.950
And now the only other thing
that we need to worry about is

6852c865-f9ac-4b32-8562-2a25b0fabaaf-1
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.030
the number format.

527a31a6-9c3c-46cd-b2d1-c85ca4b2f169-0
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.049
So we'll go to this column here
and we're going to make sure

527a31a6-9c3c-46cd-b2d1-c85ca4b2f169-1
00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.910
that it's set to numeric.

299d7573-3185-4014-92a3-9a45488bf601-0
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.196
And once we put this in, it's
going to give us some other

299d7573-3185-4014-92a3-9a45488bf601-1
00:02:31.196 --> 00:02:31.920
options.

d97c3cc5-c002-43da-a4f6-42ba178fe49c-0
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.397
And so we can change how many
decimal places our numbers going

d97c3cc5-c002-43da-a4f6-42ba178fe49c-1
00:02:36.397 --> 00:02:36.880
to have.

84d4969c-14dd-41ab-b246-98ce463f9bcd-0
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.400
And we'll just put this down to
two because we don't need 6.

35b1023b-5706-4557-bd3f-3f2ece6dfcc0-0
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:51.768
And then we'll click OK and now
we can shut this other table

35b1023b-5706-4557-bd3f-3f2ece6dfcc0-1
00:02:51.768 --> 00:02:52.600
window.

3748d5e4-9816-4e78-a0bf-0c035f68ce6e-0
00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.024
Make sure to save all of our
changes and now if we look in

3748d5e4-9816-4e78-a0bf-0c035f68ce6e-1
00:03:00.024 --> 00:03:05.599
our table for Ziama protected
area, we can see that we have a

3748d5e4-9816-4e78-a0bf-0c035f68ce6e-2
00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:11.263
new column for the area but we
don't have a number in here yet

3748d5e4-9816-4e78-a0bf-0c035f68ce6e-3
00:03:11.263 --> 00:03:14.680
as we need to calculate the
geometry.

2c7f523f-2c8d-4c82-82bd-073fed8a6763-0
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.808
So we right click on the Area
column heading and then we can

2c7f523f-2c8d-4c82-82bd-073fed8a6763-1
00:03:21.808 --> 00:03:27.400
click on Calculate Geometry and
this will bring up this window.

400f743c-2dae-401e-ad24-46156ee3a70c-0
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.743
Here our input feature is going
to be Ziama protected Area, so

400f743c-2dae-401e-ad24-46156ee3a70c-1
00:03:34.743 --> 00:03:42.087
we've already got that there. In
the field box we want to make

400f743c-2dae-401e-ad24-46156ee3a70c-2
00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:46.400
sure that the area column is
chosen.

2a2af909-6585-4ffe-9581-ff770b4b864c-0
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.878
And then for property, if we
click on the drop down arrow, we

2a2af909-6585-4ffe-9581-ff770b4b864c-1
00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:56.798
can see all the options of the
different types of geometry that

2a2af909-6585-4ffe-9581-ff770b4b864c-2
00:03:56.798 --> 00:03:57.840
we can calculate.

f7916c66-0074-4058-bff3-794156a41403-0
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.704
We just want area, so we can
click on the first option and

f7916c66-0074-4058-bff3-794156a41403-1
00:04:03.704 --> 00:04:08.880
then for area units we're going
to use square kilometers.

d7f835bc-5ca2-4fc9-8bef-f747031fb976-0
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.840
So again, that's just the first
option that we have.

f01607a4-8555-4508-bf67-74cac709e13b-0
00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.608
And then our coordinate system
is UTM zone 29 N, so that's what

f01607a4-8555-4508-bf67-74cac709e13b-1
00:04:19.608 --> 00:04:20.480
it should be.

576707cf-8043-4d21-9026-422ebd6d142c-0
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.280
So we can keep that how it is
and just hit OK.

90d8953d-297d-43f6-9062-8386197dd8f7-0
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.581
And now under the area column
heading we can see that we have

90d8953d-297d-43f6-9062-8386197dd8f7-1
00:04:34.581 --> 00:04:39.640
the area of Ziama, so it's
1221.01 kilometres squared.

ab0d8c93-42c6-4bda-aca8-ea551972a28f-0
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.717
So now have a go at calculating
the areas of the other two

ab0d8c93-42c6-4bda-aca8-ea551972a28f-1
00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:47.320
protected areas, Wonegizi and
Wologizi.
