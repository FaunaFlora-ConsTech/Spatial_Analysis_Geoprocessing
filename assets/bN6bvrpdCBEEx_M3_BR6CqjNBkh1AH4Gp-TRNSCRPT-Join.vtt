87bd0697-6673-4692-aace-0289db43cb1c-0
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.636
So hopefully now you've got
something that looks a bit like

87bd0697-6673-4692-aace-0289db43cb1c-1
00:00:04.636 --> 00:00:04.960
this.

d9ab7512-be3f-4e12-b15d-96ba39877932-0
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.654
Your 3 polygons for the
protected areas, your point data

d9ab7512-be3f-4e12-b15d-96ba39877932-1
00:00:11.654 --> 00:00:18.970
that you created from the table
and the two tables down here the

d9ab7512-be3f-4e12-b15d-96ba39877932-2
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.160
sightings and sheet one which is
the environment data.

20f340a2-d90e-465b-a6fa-ad37bfe1e0cd-0
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.200
So let's right click on this and
click open to see the table.

c5254679-5d86-4a2c-9e23-48cdf4a68e93-0
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.680
In this table we've got 3
columns.

f9feda69-2044-4d3c-858c-b25d6d329d26-0
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.671
The first one is the unique key
and this is the same as we had

f9feda69-2044-4d3c-858c-b25d6d329d26-1
00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:41.080
in the other table.

c5374601-8897-43f6-8c69-f51c431f1b89-0
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.306
So it's a different number for
each GPS point, which is each

c5374601-8897-43f6-8c69-f51c431f1b89-1
00:00:46.306 --> 00:00:47.640
row in our table.

7c2216ca-643e-42ea-98d6-e7b7aaf732d3-0
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.040
The next column is environment.

82e7a36d-1850-4aff-aabb-972a1a245bf3-0
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.240
We can see that there's lots of
different types of environment.

bd50bda1-8a94-4683-b181-4ffae0130acb-0
00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.311
The Hippogriffs are being
spotted in Grassland, Primary

bd50bda1-8a94-4683-b181-4ffae0130acb-1
00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:06.016
Forest, Secondary Forest, Farm
and village and the last column

bd50bda1-8a94-4683-b181-4ffae0130acb-2
00:01:06.016 --> 00:01:11.630
was automatically inputted by
Arc GIS Pro and it is an object

bd50bda1-8a94-4683-b181-4ffae0130acb-3
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.799
ID which is a number for each
row.

d6a3d67b-5ef6-4b68-9f19-8def6160e4a7-0
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.040
Now let's take a look at the
table for our point data.

b923bbe4-6ec0-491a-be01-40103ffedb22-0
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.008
So right click on the points in
your contents and click

b923bbe4-6ec0-491a-be01-40103ffedb22-1
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:26.120
Attribute Table.

0b645dcc-1061-4593-99ce-24be04fdf197-0
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.728
So as we remembered, this table
also has a column for the unique

0b645dcc-1061-4593-99ce-24be04fdf197-1
00:01:33.728 --> 00:01:35.640
key of each GPS point.

f2da529f-cb11-4e26-8e0f-39f965398780-0
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.254
So again we've got a row for
each GPS point which is each

f2da529f-cb11-4e26-8e0f-39f965398780-1
00:01:43.254 --> 00:01:46.520
sighting the location of each
sighting.

cbb68974-d168-4e9c-8944-4ffb19216166-0
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.160
So that's the same for both
tables.

3b05d46a-5d39-4504-a436-df1d59916e20-0
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.829
So for example, GPS one in our
point table is the same as GPS

3b05d46a-5d39-4504-a436-df1d59916e20-1
00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.360
one in our environment table.

88f868f5-4697-46b8-8ab4-a9aa93f3962d-0
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.383
So this means that the data is
related and what we can do is

88f868f5-4697-46b8-8ab4-a9aa93f3962d-1
00:02:09.383 --> 00:02:14.646
join the environment data to our
point data layer so that we have

88f868f5-4697-46b8-8ab4-a9aa93f3962d-2
00:02:14.646 --> 00:02:16.640
it all in the same place.

0a1f9846-5e7b-44d7-bb3d-bbc00bc0f482-0
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.055
So to do that we're going to add
a join to our Hippogriff

0a1f9846-5e7b-44d7-bb3d-bbc00bc0f482-1
00:02:24.055 --> 00:02:25.480
sightings data layer.

11cbf7d9-1882-4fe2-934d-96d01eb5bb8e-0
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.769
So we're going to right click on
this in our contents, go down to

11cbf7d9-1882-4fe2-934d-96d01eb5bb8e-1
00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.560
where it says joins and relates
and then click on add Join.

d61c39cd-e294-462a-bb06-f2f69f6fde66-0
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.488
And then in the tool window that
comes up, we need to put in our

d61c39cd-e294-462a-bb06-f2f69f6fde66-1
00:02:41.488 --> 00:02:42.160
parameters.

cf4d4d83-4bee-4d5b-888f-fe8e940780bf-0
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.810
So our input table is the table
where we want the information to

cf4d4d83-4bee-4d5b-888f-fe8e940780bf-1
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.804
join into and so that's our
hippogriff sightings, our point

cf4d4d83-4bee-4d5b-888f-fe8e940780bf-2
00:02:52.804 --> 00:02:53.719
data layer.

f400cf01-fd88-49a0-85d3-3e3482550cb5-0
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:02.069
And then for input join field
and for join table field In

f400cf01-fd88-49a0-85d3-3e3482550cb5-1
00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:08.400
these boxes we want to put in
the columns from each table that

f400cf01-fd88-49a0-85d3-3e3482550cb5-2
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.320
can be used to join the data
together.

8ce397b7-1f49-493a-8bf9-335e57a046f0-0
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.825
So this is our unique key column
because we have this column in

8ce397b7-1f49-493a-8bf9-335e57a046f0-1
00:03:16.825 --> 00:03:18.080
each of our tables.

9e62153f-9263-4440-8ecc-5ab76b20ec8f-0
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.800
So we can leave these both as
unique key.

1f217398-35ed-4064-9857-9f585bc065ae-0
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.958
And for join table it's what
table we want to join to our

1f217398-35ed-4064-9857-9f585bc065ae-1
00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.400
point data layer.

c2582ed8-2227-4de3-96af-686d56fefd2d-0
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.760
And so that's sheet one as
that's the environment data.

a821e034-8ffb-4d21-bb07-544e1f73bde4-0
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.925
And now we just need to hit OK
and we can check our table for

a821e034-8ffb-4d21-bb07-544e1f73bde4-1
00:03:41.925 --> 00:03:47.440
our point data layer to see if
the join has been successful.

3e6daf50-2296-4ec5-9262-a49d04c3fefe-0
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.840
And if we scroll across we can
see that we now have a column

3e6daf50-2296-4ec5-9262-a49d04c3fefe-1
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.560
for environment within our
hippogriff sightings point data

3e6daf50-2296-4ec5-9262-a49d04c3fefe-2
00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.520
layer table.

6958c77c-e101-4c67-b175-b721682022e6-0
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.566
So now that means that each
point on our map can show us

6958c77c-e101-4c67-b175-b721682022e6-1
00:04:05.566 --> 00:04:10.538
where a sighting happened, but
also the type of sighting and

6958c77c-e101-4c67-b175-b721682022e6-2
00:04:10.538 --> 00:04:13.880
the environment in which it
occurred in.

1fccbdbb-0d09-4a16-a810-a0127a7b8526-0
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.320
So that's great, we've added the
data in.

66edb613-baba-47c0-b35a-d1f808ca9076-0
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.117
But when you add a join to save
the data into the layer, you

66edb613-baba-47c0-b35a-d1f808ca9076-1
00:04:23.117 --> 00:04:25.520
need to export that layer.

f826d20e-22b0-4e71-8fda-3252bc6f7472-0
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.323
So we need to right click on our
Hippogriff Sightings layer, go

f826d20e-22b0-4e71-8fda-3252bc6f7472-1
00:04:31.323 --> 00:04:34.600
into Data and click on Export
Features.

e59ba027-3e1b-4e89-8bf3-f86004cfd392-0
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.139
Our input features is our
Hippogriff Sightings point

e59ba027-3e1b-4e89-8bf3-f86004cfd392-1
00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:43.640
layer.

5e6cb9a0-44f7-4286-a6b6-b68ec93d2fc0-0
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.600
So we can leave this how it is.

6a259d91-d319-4892-8b9a-7a99687604c9-0
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.485
And then the box underneath is
where we want to save this layer

6a259d91-d319-4892-8b9a-7a99687604c9-1
00:04:51.485 --> 00:04:51.720
to.

f66de7ee-bb2c-4ecd-92da-950bef61a2f0-0
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.113
So click on the browse icon and
we're going to save it in our

f66de7ee-bb2c-4ecd-92da-950bef61a2f0-1
00:04:56.113 --> 00:04:58.240
Geo database for this project.

25c345d3-a864-4db6-b947-458c7074653c-0
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.408
So go into your Geo database and
then we'll call this layer

25c345d3-a864-4db6-b947-458c7074653c-1
00:05:04.408 --> 00:05:07.120
Sightings Environment points.

0db2f1ef-feea-4135-beeb-174cb658c5ca-0
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:22.683
Click save and then click OK and
that will create a new layer

0db2f1ef-feea-4135-beeb-174cb658c5ca-1
00:05:22.683 --> 00:05:29.730
that has the join saves within
it.

b86a64fe-f309-4a08-a689-331264abfdb3-0
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.605
So you should be able to see
that new layer in your contents

b86a64fe-f309-4a08-a689-331264abfdb3-1
00:05:38.605 --> 00:05:43.470
now, and we can just turn off
the other point layer as we

b86a64fe-f309-4a08-a689-331264abfdb3-2
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.005
don't need that anymore and just
remember to hit save to save our

b86a64fe-f309-4a08-a689-331264abfdb3-3
00:05:49.005 --> 00:05:49.759
progress.
