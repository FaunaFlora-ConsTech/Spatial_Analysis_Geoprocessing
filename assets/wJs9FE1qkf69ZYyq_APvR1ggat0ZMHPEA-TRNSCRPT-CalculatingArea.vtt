649fdd35-0523-49b6-ad3c-47de03b3e520-0
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.174
Now that you have projected all
your data layers and your map,

649fdd35-0523-49b6-ad3c-47de03b3e520-1
00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:10.160
you're ready to do some area
calculations.

9ffaa69b-4c9f-4eb4-9f31-a4c30249102c-0
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.318
So when you do any geometry
calculations in QGIS, you first

9ffaa69b-4c9f-4eb4-9f31-a4c30249102c-1
00:00:16.318 --> 00:00:21.732
of all need to set the units of
your project so that you know

9ffaa69b-4c9f-4eb4-9f31-a4c30249102c-2
00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:26.359
what units these measurements
are being measured in.

c4d30db5-9523-40a7-8e4f-3b16c2a272c9-0
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:33.254
So to do that you need to go
into the Project tab and go into

c4d30db5-9523-40a7-8e4f-3b16c2a272c9-1
00:00:33.254 --> 00:00:39.469
properties, and in this project
properties window you want to

c4d30db5-9523-40a7-8e4f-3b16c2a272c9-2
00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:45.584
make sure you're in the General
tab and we're going to be in

c4d30db5-9523-40a7-8e4f-3b16c2a272c9-3
00:00:45.584 --> 00:00:48.090
this measurement section.

aa080a16-7be7-4630-8121-9acc6846b884-0
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.905
So in here we can see that we
can set the units for distance

aa080a16-7be7-4630-8121-9acc6846b884-1
00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:54.530
measurement and the units for
area measurement.

6908afe0-1ad9-43e2-bd94-a8adb1bcd1e2-0
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.680
We don't need to worry about
distance as we're not

6908afe0-1ad9-43e2-bd94-a8adb1bcd1e2-1
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.560
calculating that.

0748ef0a-7d5a-4b8a-a1e5-48a3805a5844-0
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.276
So we'll just make sure that the
units for area measurement is

0748ef0a-7d5a-4b8a-a1e5-48a3805a5844-1
00:01:02.276 --> 00:01:03.640
set to square kilometres.

ee97707b-8623-4bba-b9a4-0ff751ceaa11-0
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.156
So we'll set that, we'll hit,
apply and hit OK, and now we can

ee97707b-8623-4bba-b9a4-0ff751ceaa11-1
00:01:10.156 --> 00:01:11.760
calculate the area.

8f9af52a-cd29-4a52-89a4-312a75ec078b-0
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.658
So we'll start off calculating
the area for Ziama and when you

8f9af52a-cd29-4a52-89a4-312a75ec078b-1
00:01:16.658 --> 00:01:20.572
calculate area in QGIS, you need
to use that layers attribute

8f9af52a-cd29-4a52-89a4-312a75ec078b-2
00:01:20.572 --> 00:01:21.520
table to do so.

69382499-e7e2-4064-84d6-6ef69b2e53be-0
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.490
So we're going to open up Ziama
protected area attribute table

69382499-e7e2-4064-84d6-6ef69b2e53be-1
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.399
and now we need to create a new
field or a new column to

69382499-e7e2-4064-84d6-6ef69b2e53be-2
00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.680
calculate the area in.

e7f053d9-31e5-4aa0-8905-6ce6ae774428-0
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.755
So to do that we need to toggle
editing mode on using this

e7f053d9-31e5-4aa0-8905-6ce6ae774428-1
00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:48.347
button here and then go across
to the new field button which is

e7f053d9-31e5-4aa0-8905-6ce6ae774428-2
00:01:48.347 --> 00:01:53.240
here and click on this which
will bring up this pop up.

677389cc-ff88-4c7e-86cb-66a97ec0104a-0
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.308
So here in name we can name our
new column so we'll name it Area

677389cc-ff88-4c7e-86cb-66a97ec0104a-1
00:01:59.308 --> 00:02:04.590
and for type we'll make sure
that it says decimal number and

677389cc-ff88-4c7e-86cb-66a97ec0104a-2
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.699
then the length number is how
many numbers there can be in

677389cc-ff88-4c7e-86cb-66a97ec0104a-3
00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:14.548
your total number and the
precision is how many decimal

677389cc-ff88-4c7e-86cb-66a97ec0104a-4
00:02:14.548 --> 00:02:16.280
places there can be.

c99b742c-acc6-4927-8461-99dc01f36e4d-0
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.281
So we'll keep length the same
but we'll turn down precision to

c99b742c-acc6-4927-8461-99dc01f36e4d-1
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:20.520
two.

4bf2076b-99a2-47c8-85de-2df8dc2ef124-0
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.440
So our area will have two
decimal places and hit.

84a70f44-9701-43a3-b6dd-46712c976bd2-0
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.240
OK so now we have our new column
for area.

08d42e0a-ba15-4e8d-a429-c74f786d76d1-0
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.560
So we're going to use this
column to calculate the area.

8d7d060f-9b48-4718-a4ba-8b086cb65608-0
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.803
So the way we can do this is by
using this drop down box here to

8d7d060f-9b48-4718-a4ba-8b086cb65608-1
00:02:37.803 --> 00:02:42.217
select the area column and then
this is where we can put in the

8d7d060f-9b48-4718-a4ba-8b086cb65608-2
00:02:42.217 --> 00:02:44.080
function to calculate area.

2e48656a-b67a-4ac1-95bb-55f198cc9f44-0
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.955
So that's $ and then area and
now we can click update all and

2e48656a-b67a-4ac1-95bb-55f198cc9f44-1
00:02:50.955 --> 00:02:52.240
there we go.

3be4aad5-20d9-465e-a330-f9f44096ea63-0
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.923
That's populated the row under
area with the total area of

3be4aad5-20d9-465e-a330-f9f44096ea63-1
00:02:56.923 --> 00:02:57.400
Ziama.

9ae590e1-e7ce-44ce-a9f9-cc73e58ac7d5-0
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.920
So we can see that it's 1221.95
kilometres squared.

97147d88-353f-4c47-8242-61f4a5d27a59-0
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.200
And now we've made a change to
our table.

814717d8-8985-4d5e-8c5e-3f4956031517-0
00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.321
So let's just remember to save
our edits so we can use the

814717d8-8985-4d5e-8c5e-3f4956031517-1
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:16.530
third button from the left at
the top of our table to do so

814717d8-8985-4d5e-8c5e-3f4956031517-2
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.085
and toggle editing mode off and
that's how to calculate area in

814717d8-8985-4d5e-8c5e-3f4956031517-3
00:03:22.085 --> 00:03:22.520
QGIS.

20b243be-14e6-4eef-8eb9-82551bd95e1b-0
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.573
So now have a go at doing the
same for the Wonegizi and

20b243be-14e6-4eef-8eb9-82551bd95e1b-1
00:03:26.573 --> 00:03:28.240
Wologizi protected areas.

a3a17b73-0706-414c-8e5e-c3f31ca22ade-0
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.532
You don't need to worry about
setting the project units

a3a17b73-0706-414c-8e5e-c3f31ca22ade-1
00:03:31.532 --> 00:03:33.520
anymore as we've already done
that.

5bec00f6-ce26-405b-9a60-dfd2c827716a-0
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.807
So just open up the attribute
table for these two other

5bec00f6-ce26-405b-9a60-dfd2c827716a-1
00:03:36.807 --> 00:03:40.447
protected areas, create a new
field and calculate the area in

5bec00f6-ce26-405b-9a60-dfd2c827716a-2
00:03:40.447 --> 00:03:40.800
there.
