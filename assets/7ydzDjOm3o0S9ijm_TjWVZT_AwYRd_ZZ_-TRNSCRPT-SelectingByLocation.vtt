00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.374
In this video we're going to
learn how to select our data by

6fda84be-5763-497e-8b4a-eacb07a9e809-1
00:00:06.374 --> 00:00:07.120
location.

21dc025b-4a31-4d21-9cf0-e71a26af1dc5-0
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.577
To begin with, we need to make
sure that we clear any selection

21dc025b-4a31-4d21-9cf0-e71a26af1dc5-1
00:00:12.577 --> 00:00:16.320
or defined query that we have on
our data already.

e8c64628-b0f7-4ea8-98a4-16f576f63b49-0
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.280
To do that, we need to go back
into our point layer properties.

707789be-3f79-43d3-a931-fea28326a772-0
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.031
So right click on our points
layer and go into properties and

707789be-3f79-43d3-a931-fea28326a772-1
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:35.422
we want to be in the source tab
to go back into query builder

707789be-3f79-43d3-a931-fea28326a772-2
00:00:35.422 --> 00:00:40.680
and now we can hit the button
clear at the bottom.

d3965d76-9042-4f3a-b79d-498c4433f55d-0
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.617
Click OK and then click apply on
the property window and now we

d3965d76-9042-4f3a-b79d-498c4433f55d-1
00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:49.682
can see we have all of our
points back and there's no

d3965d76-9042-4f3a-b79d-498c4433f55d-2
00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:52.920
defined query on our points
layer anymore.

44165490-2a4b-455f-a648-91ae060b4381-0
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.088
If you had a selection on your
data as well that you needed to

44165490-2a4b-455f-a648-91ae060b4381-1
00:00:59.088 --> 00:01:04.000
clear, you can use this deselect
button in the selection toolbar.

e8595ecd-1297-4e6b-a34a-136c7432b712-0
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.612
If you don't have the selection
toolbar, you just need to right

e8595ecd-1297-4e6b-a34a-136c7432b712-1
00:01:09.612 --> 00:01:13.760
click at the top in the toolbars
and now you can toggle it on.

77cce844-fad0-4898-8820-ed8337a26c3d-0
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.048
So we're going to use the Select
by Location tool in this video

77cce844-fad0-4898-8820-ed8337a26c3d-1
00:01:21.048 --> 00:01:24.880
to see how many sighting points
were in the Ziama protected

77cce844-fad0-4898-8820-ed8337a26c3d-2
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.199
area.

07bbf33e-755d-4871-93d0-07bc537993ba-0
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.387
We'll use the quick access
button in the selection toolbar

07bbf33e-755d-4871-93d0-07bc537993ba-1
00:01:30.387 --> 00:01:35.176
where we just were and it's the
fourth button along to select by

07bbf33e-755d-4871-93d0-07bc537993ba-2
00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:35.840
location.

9d2c828f-3d18-48fc-8bca-05223ab09439-0
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.560
So we'll click on this and it
will bring up this window.

d6faa245-b4cc-45f4-9779-003f695a2d77-0
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.471
And then for the first drop down
box, we want to select features

d6faa245-b4cc-45f4-9779-003f695a2d77-1
00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:47.160
from our sighting points.

16f8e3bc-3e88-4f0e-8b0d-6df52a585dd9-0
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.210
And so we can leave that how it
is or you can click on the drop

16f8e3bc-3e88-4f0e-8b0d-6df52a585dd9-1
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.720
down box to choose this if you
don't have it.

87682fc4-3bf2-4587-9d97-f706c0a7abe8-0
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.254
And we want it to be where the
features are within the Ziama

87682fc4-3bf2-4587-9d97-f706c0a7abe8-1
00:01:59.254 --> 00:02:00.360
protected area.

d1864b66-10b8-4a20-99e3-90811d178a7d-0
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.384
So we're going to choose the are
within button for this section

d1864b66-10b8-4a20-99e3-90811d178a7d-1
00:02:05.384 --> 00:02:10.094
and we want to compare to the
features from Ziama protected

d1864b66-10b8-4a20-99e3-90811d178a7d-2
00:02:10.094 --> 00:02:14.647
area as this is the one that
we're interested in to begin

d1864b66-10b8-4a20-99e3-90811d178a7d-3
00:02:14.647 --> 00:02:15.040
with.

785d6f9b-7458-451a-9d88-c648dd3b26d7-0
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.812
So we'll choose Ziama PA in this
box and underneath this we want

785d6f9b-7458-451a-9d88-c648dd3b26d7-1
00:02:22.812 --> 00:02:29.284
to make sure that this says
create a new selection and to

785d6f9b-7458-451a-9d88-c648dd3b26d7-2
00:02:29.284 --> 00:02:34.640
run a selection tool in the
proper way in QGIS.

61d9fc39-1897-4aa1-9db8-192e9318db13-0
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.618
We would want our data to all be
in the same coordinate reference

61d9fc39-1897-4aa1-9db8-192e9318db13-1
00:02:38.618 --> 00:02:39.040
system.

be84f475-84a0-488f-855d-9c4bd7045b25-0
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.420
Our point data is in a different
coordinate system to Ziama

be84f475-84a0-488f-855d-9c4bd7045b25-1
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.320
protected area as we haven't
projected it yet.

8fd16d77-fd50-47da-94cd-2298abd9ccbe-0
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.310
So it's still in a geographic
coordinate system, whereas the

8fd16d77-fd50-47da-94cd-2298abd9ccbe-1
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.200
Ziama protected area is in a
projected system.

79d6b416-abef-4d8d-b0e5-71ff18f894ac-0
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.564
We'll be covering how to project
GIS data in a later lesson in

79d6b416-abef-4d8d-b0e5-71ff18f894ac-1
00:02:57.564 --> 00:02:58.320
this course.

3b0a250a-cf84-49c7-b94c-42b36cbaaacc-0
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.768
So for now, we're going to
choose an option to bypass the

3b0a250a-cf84-49c7-b94c-42b36cbaaacc-1
00:03:02.768 --> 00:03:07.368
fact that we haven't projected
this data and that's by clicking

3b0a250a-cf84-49c7-b94c-42b36cbaaacc-2
00:03:07.368 --> 00:03:11.752
on the spanner icon that's just
to the right of the where we

3b0a250a-cf84-49c7-b94c-42b36cbaaacc-3
00:03:11.752 --> 00:03:16.280
chose the Ziama protected area
option which will bring up this

3b0a250a-cf84-49c7-b94c-42b36cbaaacc-4
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.639
page.

a788fbc3-4291-40df-988f-3aa846b81657-0
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.040
And in the top drop down box we
want to choose do not filter.

c9937ef4-ce29-43ed-ac4e-dab03e10bb68-0
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.215
Now we can go back and we can
hit run and our select tool is

c9937ef4-ce29-43ed-ac4e-dab03e10bb68-1
00:03:29.215 --> 00:03:34.640
going to run and now we can see
that it's highlighted.

717baa05-d07e-45a9-a222-6ba30cf772ce-0
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.017
It's selected all the points
that have occurred within all

717baa05-d07e-45a9-a222-6ba30cf772ce-1
00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:41.280
the sightings that occurred
within Ziama protected area.

5fa9cd49-92dd-43a9-9b07-f67f87bd0850-0
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.360
So we want to know how many
occurred in Ziama.

e523c58c-8a64-4545-a34a-5e5250778f6b-0
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.515
We could just count the points
that we can see on our map that

e523c58c-8a64-4545-a34a-5e5250778f6b-1
00:03:49.515 --> 00:03:50.480
are highlighted.

ce3c5dab-8548-42bf-bc02-d184660c1c00-0
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.960
But if we had a large data set,
this would take a long time.

67a56d2d-3e51-4e0e-a28c-9d0937fbeefa-0
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.295
So a better way to do this is to
open up the attribute table and

67a56d2d-3e51-4e0e-a28c-9d0937fbeefa-1
00:03:59.295 --> 00:04:03.813
then at the very top of the
table it tells us how many rows

67a56d2d-3e51-4e0e-a28c-9d0937fbeefa-2
00:04:03.813 --> 00:04:06.600
there are and how many are
selected.

91762838-e28e-4a15-ab57-c00b0c820a25-0
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.691
So it's telling us that 32 rows
are selected, so 32 sightings

91762838-e28e-4a15-ab57-c00b0c820a25-1
00:04:11.691 --> 00:04:14.640
happened within Ziama protected
area.

1aecb555-90e4-461f-b22f-d06ae7680442-0
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.593
We can also see the points that
are selected as they're

1aecb555-90e4-461f-b22f-d06ae7680442-1
00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:26.157
highlighted in the table and we
could click on the button within

1aecb555-90e4-461f-b22f-d06ae7680442-2
00:04:26.157 --> 00:04:28.640
the the top bar of the table.

446bf0e5-b048-47a9-9e14-960f0435b205-0
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.600
That lets us move all the
selected rows to the top.

370b1606-f62e-48a5-8f31-f11af026a22f-0
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.120
So it's this button here.

622cd1e6-b114-4650-b41f-59c089139438-0
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.720
And now all the selected rows
are at the top.

c0fdec0a-a1fc-473d-a339-eb9cc72bd285-0
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.960
So now just remember to clear
the selection.

403ab36f-f4fc-4a11-bcd4-ca82bf3532c7-0
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.040
We can use the clear selection
button in the table here or we

403ab36f-f4fc-4a11-bcd4-ca82bf3532c7-1
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.711
could also deselect the features
using the button in the

403ab36f-f4fc-4a11-bcd4-ca82bf3532c7-2
00:04:56.711 --> 00:05:02.120
selection toolbar and now have a
go at doing the same process for

403ab36f-f4fc-4a11-bcd4-ca82bf3532c7-3
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.528
Wonegizi and Wologizi to see how
many sighting points occurred in

403ab36f-f4fc-4a11-bcd4-ca82bf3532c7-4
00:05:07.528 --> 00:05:08.839
these two areas.
