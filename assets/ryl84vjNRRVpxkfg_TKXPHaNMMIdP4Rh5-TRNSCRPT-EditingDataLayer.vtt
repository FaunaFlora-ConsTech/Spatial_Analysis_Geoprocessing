00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.211
In this video, we're going to
edit our sightings data layer so

d939741f-d663-4144-bda2-5324315634f5-1
00:00:05.211 --> 00:00:07.800
that we can add a new sighting
point.

0732041d-5ab2-43df-9062-f2b784ca947d-0
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.174
To edit a data layer in QGIS,
you first of all need to put the

0732041d-5ab2-43df-9062-f2b784ca947d-1
00:00:13.174 --> 00:00:16.720
data layer that you're editing
in editing mode.

e3df9b54-d8db-4d3b-b532-96a8688c0827-0
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.274
So we'll click on our sighting
points in our layers list, right

e3df9b54-d8db-4d3b-b532-96a8688c0827-1
00:00:23.274 --> 00:00:27.640
click, and then you can click
Toggle Editing.

6135d187-ab11-4a21-b82f-73ed1e911c24-0
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.957
Here you could also do that by
having your layer selected and

6135d187-ab11-4a21-b82f-73ed1e911c24-1
00:00:32.957 --> 00:00:38.360
clicking the pencil icon in the
digitising toolbar at the top.

08d1e952-3834-4497-94c4-3bccc4ad2e10-0
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.040
So now we've got editing toggled
on.

1ac63e8c-1ff4-4b8b-bd63-12f5dafdaffa-0
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.989
We can go into the Edit tab, and
here we have the buttons to add

1ac63e8c-1ff4-4b8b-bd63-12f5dafdaffa-1
00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.480
features as well as we can move
features.

6ef88ea8-1c1e-4676-8fe9-edbf6b9cefc6-0
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.604
We can delete features in here,
and we also have options for

6ef88ea8-1c1e-4676-8fe9-edbf6b9cefc6-1
00:01:03.604 --> 00:01:08.280
rotating and reshaping points,
lines, and polygons.

473ff19b-26a7-4a5c-bf4d-0a6ad30a91c8-0
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.744
But we're going to click Add
Point Feature, which is going to

473ff19b-26a7-4a5c-bf4d-0a6ad30a91c8-1
00:01:12.744 --> 00:01:16.200
give our mouse the tool to draw
on a new point.

f10d50ed-e7b0-4bff-b991-93a2a6a2ba3d-0
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.768
So we're going to go on where
that point is in the Wonegizi

f10d50ed-e7b0-4bff-b991-93a2a6a2ba3d-1
00:01:19.768 --> 00:01:20.640
protected area.

949b1cce-baf0-4855-84ad-2c0918c02e18-0
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.352
We'll click and it will bring up
this window where we can put in

949b1cce-baf0-4855-84ad-2c0918c02e18-1
00:01:24.352 --> 00:01:27.000
the information for the point
that we're adding.

b2f8eb9a-83ab-4682-b947-81708897185a-0
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.080
So we'll just add in the
information that we know.

b2dde8ba-6835-44db-9cfd-5ccc5adfa3e8-0
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.432
We know the date because it's
the same date as the other nest

b2dde8ba-6835-44db-9cfd-5ccc5adfa3e8-1
00:01:35.432 --> 00:01:39.840
sighting in Wonegizi, which is
the 25th of November 2022.

34801b88-c301-407d-b38c-f7de14ee9870-0
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:48.177
So we can type it in or we can
use the drop down arrow to

34801b88-c301-407d-b38c-f7de14ee9870-1
00:01:48.177 --> 00:01:56.322
change the date, the month and
the day, and then we can put in

34801b88-c301-407d-b38c-f7de14ee9870-2
00:01:56.322 --> 00:02:03.690
the sighting and the environment
as we know its nest and

34801b88-c301-407d-b38c-f7de14ee9870-3
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.120
secondary forest and then we'll
click OK.

6cff2de0-f409-41fe-ba42-246876c5cbe3-0
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.015
If you weren't happy with where
you've put your point, what you

6cff2de0-f409-41fe-ba42-246876c5cbe3-1
00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:22.088
can do is go into the edit tab
and now we can click Move

6cff2de0-f409-41fe-ba42-246876c5cbe3-2
00:02:22.088 --> 00:02:22.800
feature.

f01ccfc8-4a03-4a7d-abec-0e77bd557002-0
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.607
You can click on the point that
you've added and then you'll be

f01ccfc8-4a03-4a7d-abec-0e77bd557002-1
00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:35.256
able to hold your mouse button
down and drag it to where you

f01ccfc8-4a03-4a7d-abec-0e77bd557002-2
00:02:35.256 --> 00:02:35.720
want.

19cc9f2e-0ff3-4729-a951-70bf2201c753-0
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:44.205
So get it to how you want it to
be, which is in the same place

19cc9f2e-0ff3-4729-a951-70bf2201c753-1
00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:51.565
as the other nest sighting, and
then once you're happy with it,

19cc9f2e-0ff3-4729-a951-70bf2201c753-2
00:02:51.565 --> 00:02:58.235
we can save our changes by
clicking on the save button in

19cc9f2e-0ff3-4729-a951-70bf2201c753-3
00:02:58.235 --> 00:03:00.880
the digitizing toolbar.

5bb9f4b8-1bb9-4bab-bc02-a8b6215de524-0
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.960
The save layer edits and we're
going to toggle editing off now.

e85fd9b3-aafc-48bd-95a4-da3d0313b112-0
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.761
So let's go into our sightings
attribute table to see the point

e85fd9b3-aafc-48bd-95a4-da3d0313b112-1
00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:21.455
that we've just added, and if we
Scroll down to the bottom, we

e85fd9b3-aafc-48bd-95a4-da3d0313b112-2
00:03:21.455 --> 00:03:23.900
can see our point here.

32bb7337-2268-480a-9499-1d21cdf8f484-0
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.205
So even though we've plotted our
point on our map, we still don't

32bb7337-2268-480a-9499-1d21cdf8f484-1
00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:31.440
have a longitude or latitude for
it.

eb172082-01cf-46da-8276-93b080cd5e53-0
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.944
And that's because we need to
manually calculate this in our

eb172082-01cf-46da-8276-93b080cd5e53-1
00:03:35.944 --> 00:03:36.360
table.

a60139d8-2cf2-454a-9f84-443563302beb-0
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.787
So to do that, we're going to
toggle editing on again using

a60139d8-2cf2-454a-9f84-443563302beb-1
00:03:42.787 --> 00:03:47.973
the pencil icon in the top left,
Scroll down to our row and then

a60139d8-2cf2-454a-9f84-443563302beb-2
00:03:47.973 --> 00:03:52.920
we can select it by clicking on
the number to the left of it.

d6b04e62-607b-4c05-ac1e-30b6169f507d-0
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.698
And then we'll choose the column
that we're calculating, which is

d6b04e62-607b-4c05-ac1e-30b6169f507d-1
00:03:59.698 --> 00:04:04.600
the longitude in the drop down
box just above the table here.

295d9fe6-d469-4d5f-9eb6-b6f53264c3d4-0
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.240
So I'll click on this and we'll
choose longitude.

daa473f1-2d64-4831-8712-4b19f5baef0f-0
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.526
And then in the box next to it
is where we can type in the

daa473f1-2d64-4831-8712-4b19f5baef0f-1
00:04:12.526 --> 00:04:14.800
formula for what we're
calculating.

1c11cd0c-87b4-49b5-8142-05b806f2d28f-0
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.275
So to calculate longitude we can
type in $ and X because you go

1c11cd0c-87b4-49b5-8142-05b806f2d28f-1
00:04:20.275 --> 00:04:24.796
along the corridor and up the
stairs so it's X after the

1c11cd0c-87b4-49b5-8142-05b806f2d28f-2
00:04:24.796 --> 00:04:29.872
dollar sign and then we'll click
update selected and now in our

1c11cd0c-87b4-49b5-8142-05b806f2d28f-3
00:04:29.872 --> 00:04:33.600
row we can see that's populated
the longitude.

bafec28b-4b5f-41a4-9eb1-212d8c38efdc-0
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.160
So we just need to do the same
for the latitude.

b5db34e0-eeec-4d38-a607-6066d36defcf-0
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.828
We'll change this so it says
latitude and then we'll change

b5db34e0-eeec-4d38-a607-6066d36defcf-1
00:04:41.828 --> 00:04:47.120
the X to a Y and click update
selected and there we go.

ed4a8f1a-631d-4685-a213-dfe441d8aca4-0
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.284
That's how to edit a data layer
in QGIS and we've made some

ed4a8f1a-631d-4685-a213-dfe441d8aca4-1
00:04:52.284 --> 00:04:56.760
changes to our tables, so just
remember to save it.

b3a423f4-b4af-4782-9648-55791f17f3c1-0
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.591
We can toggle the editing off
and then click save and then

b3a423f4-b4af-4782-9648-55791f17f3c1-1
00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:06.080
we'll shut our table and just
hit save for our whole project.
