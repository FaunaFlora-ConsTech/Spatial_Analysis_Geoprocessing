8fc58360-d5e9-440c-8184-4f098781a771-0
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.086
And now we're going to export
the table information that's

8fc58360-d5e9-440c-8184-4f098781a771-1
00:00:05.086 --> 00:00:08.312
attached to the selected
sighting points for each

8fc58360-d5e9-440c-8184-4f098781a771-2
00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:09.280
protected area.

802768fd-fa41-4a5a-9509-f6174660d80f-0
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.080
In this video we'll go through
how to do this for Ziama.

9e730b8a-c379-4559-8c49-51c4780f3ca2-0
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.304
So let's open up the attribute
table for the sighting points

9e730b8a-c379-4559-8c49-51c4780f3ca2-1
00:00:23.304 --> 00:00:25.360
occurring in just Ziama.

83630ec9-d15e-4eb9-bcda-dd8c99cdf575-0
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.400
So it's our Ziama sightings
layer.

9b453555-f21b-490f-b911-7a590f6bdb2f-0
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.209
We'll right click open up the
attribute table for this layer

9b453555-f21b-490f-b911-7a590f6bdb2f-1
00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:39.805
and we can see that when we
exported these selected points,

9b453555-f21b-490f-b911-7a590f6bdb2f-2
00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:45.307
it also exported all of the
attribute information attached

9b453555-f21b-490f-b911-7a590f6bdb2f-3
00:00:45.307 --> 00:00:46.800
to these points.

a735e3a6-fd6e-48b0-9223-74d610170071-0
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.423
And so this is what we want to
export and give to Ziama

a735e3a6-fd6e-48b0-9223-74d610170071-1
00:00:51.423 --> 00:00:52.480
protected area.

3503f970-bfe7-4768-ac4c-72db883e2f88-0
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.160
So let's export this table.

339143fb-0621-498b-9525-06c2ac947fc3-0
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.629
So to do that, if we have the
table open, we can go into the

339143fb-0621-498b-9525-06c2ac947fc3-1
00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.371
Table tab at the top of Arc Pro
here and we can click the Export

339143fb-0621-498b-9525-06c2ac947fc3-2
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:08.519
Table button.

78598c30-dc24-4bc8-b6a6-0a6eabbb7065-0
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.520
That's here.

fc0e5b2a-622e-4443-baab-e12b9d373b6a-0
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.292
We could also do this by right
clicking on the data layer,

fc0e5b2a-622e-4443-baab-e12b9d373b6a-1
00:01:15.292 --> 00:01:19.492
going into or hovering over the
data section that we normally go

fc0e5b2a-622e-4443-baab-e12b9d373b6a-2
00:01:19.492 --> 00:01:22.400
into and then click Export Table
from there.

714129c2-74ee-4394-a9cb-73e9dc3cdcb5-0
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.709
So our input table is our Ziama
sightings and we need to choose

714129c2-74ee-4394-a9cb-73e9dc3cdcb5-1
00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:31.920
where to save the exported table
into.

fd5076a0-8b0d-4370-9c30-cc2ddd59ee65-0
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.880
So we're going to save it into
the folder that we created for

fd5076a0-8b0d-4370-9c30-cc2ddd59ee65-1
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:38.800
the Ziama data.

2ae9999e-0a31-4b2f-80a0-4ef5ff71a58d-0
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:48.182
So it's here, it's the Ziama PA
folder and we'll name it

2ae9999e-0a31-4b2f-80a0-4ef5ff71a58d-1
00:01:48.182 --> 00:01:51.680
Sightings Table Ziama.

0d7cd80a-e2ff-455b-921d-74cd7feb8475-0
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.113
And we also need to add the
suffix dot CSV to the end of

0d7cd80a-e2ff-455b-921d-74cd7feb8475-1
00:01:58.113 --> 00:02:03.627
this file name so it saves it as
a CSV file which is a table

0d7cd80a-e2ff-455b-921d-74cd7feb8475-2
00:02:03.627 --> 00:02:04.079
file.

a168126b-4a98-4f99-b6e9-947a70cce912-0
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.650
So we need to make sure that we
write dot CSV then we can click

a168126b-4a98-4f99-b6e9-947a70cce912-1
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.160
save and we can see this file
name in our output table.

8bcb57ef-7416-4106-a556-64de8db091c8-0
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:22.751
So now we can hit OK and we can
see in our contents now that

8bcb57ef-7416-4106-a556-64de8db091c8-1
00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:27.320
this has exported the table.

950f26c3-0e51-4b20-81af-47f3f8d7fa8c-0
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.522
So now we want to see into this
Ziama PA folder because we're

950f26c3-0e51-4b20-81af-47f3f8d7fa8c-1
00:02:33.522 --> 00:02:37.080
going to zip it up to send to
Ziama protected area.

b9d93313-16a1-487b-9b99-8e8a3869ab07-0
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.842
So what we're going to do is
we're going to save our project

b9d93313-16a1-487b-9b99-8e8a3869ab07-1
00:02:42.842 --> 00:02:48.794
and we're going to exit it and
then we're going to go into our

b9d93313-16a1-487b-9b99-8e8a3869ab07-2
00:02:48.794 --> 00:02:54.084
computers File Explorer or
Finder application and we're

b9d93313-16a1-487b-9b99-8e8a3869ab07-3
00:02:54.084 --> 00:02:59.280
going to navigate to that Ziama
protected area folder.

d08772a8-fa6a-4e69-8210-fe4201b094f5-0
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:12.251
So it's here for me and if we go
inside, we can see that we've

d08772a8-fa6a-4e69-8210-fe4201b094f5-1
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:17.440
got our Hippogriff sightings
shapefile.

acc69e20-59f2-416d-b35d-155e955abe3e-0
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.563
Hopefully you can remember that
a shape file is actually

acc69e20-59f2-416d-b35d-155e955abe3e-1
00:03:21.563 --> 00:03:22.480
multiple files.

61fdfc2c-e34a-4a18-9d7a-c5c487ac758c-0
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.648
And so all of these files make
up the sightings shapefile and

61fdfc2c-e34a-4a18-9d7a-c5c487ac758c-1
00:03:28.648 --> 00:03:32.428
we have the
sightings_table_ziama.csv

61fdfc2c-e34a-4a18-9d7a-c5c487ac758c-2
00:03:32.428 --> 00:03:34.120
document as well.

d934f2b1-661a-405a-a0b9-d659c5827d11-0
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.464
And so this is why we created a
new folder for these materials,

d934f2b1-661a-405a-a0b9-d659c5827d11-1
00:03:39.464 --> 00:03:42.080
because we've got quite a few
files here.

d1bff2bf-6835-4a28-b533-e034369adce1-0
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.461
And so the best practice for
sending GIS materials to people

d1bff2bf-6835-4a28-b533-e034369adce1-1
00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:52.636
is to put all the associated
files, material files within a

d1bff2bf-6835-4a28-b533-e034369adce1-2
00:03:52.636 --> 00:03:53.240
folder.

5b5f58ca-9996-4f3a-9649-417c2d8f7802-0
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.760
And now we can zip these up.

0e2a2174-d3df-45ec-b601-753c2777e625-0
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.504
So we'll right click on this
folder, we're going to choose

0e2a2174-d3df-45ec-b601-753c2777e625-1
00:04:01.504 --> 00:04:06.320
send to a compressed zipped
folder and there we go.

43c6033b-5b20-469b-8542-312ae985fbdf-0
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.800
It's going to zip up our
materials.

f5bb9960-8ca0-4d61-9089-f6bb03f34eb7-0
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.547
And now we could, if we wanted
to, e-mail this to the protected

f5bb9960-8ca0-4d61-9089-f6bb03f34eb7-1
00:04:13.547 --> 00:04:18.166
area for example, we can easily
attach this zipped folder to the

f5bb9960-8ca0-4d61-9089-f6bb03f34eb7-2
00:04:18.166 --> 00:04:22.713
e-mail and then the person who
receives the e-mail can unzip it

f5bb9960-8ca0-4d61-9089-f6bb03f34eb7-3
00:04:22.713 --> 00:04:25.839
and work with it within their
GIS software.

1ffc0c16-5caf-447b-ad3e-c0debfca6c6a-0
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.227
So now have a go at doing the
same process for Wonegizi and

1ffc0c16-5caf-447b-ad3e-c0debfca6c6a-1
00:04:31.227 --> 00:04:36.077
Wologizi and make sure that once
you have the tables within the

1ffc0c16-5caf-447b-ad3e-c0debfca6c6a-2
00:04:36.077 --> 00:04:39.640
associated folder that you zip
up that folder.
