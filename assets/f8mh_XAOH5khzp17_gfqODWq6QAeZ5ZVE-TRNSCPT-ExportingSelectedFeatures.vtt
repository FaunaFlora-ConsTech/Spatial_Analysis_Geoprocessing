00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.936
To export selected features, the
first thing you need to do is

2163c1ce-6d7c-4b27-ad29-9dba1684eace-1
00:00:05.936 --> 00:00:08.680
run the required selection on
your data.

8326e9b0-cda3-4488-8da5-85ec164d17ba-0
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.159
In this video, we'll go over how
to export features selected by

8326e9b0-cda3-4488-8da5-85ec164d17ba-1
00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:14.840
location.

375042f4-3892-43c3-8e90-5902a32f8309-0
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.273
For Ziama we will run a
selection like we did previously

375042f4-3892-43c3-8e90-5902a32f8309-1
00:00:19.273 --> 00:00:20.440
in this course.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.564
So we can go into the map tab
and in the selection section we

a4412132-39d4-4929-8a90-a70160cc8b33-1
00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:31.753
can choose or click on the
select by location tool which

a4412132-39d4-4929-8a90-a70160cc8b33-2
00:00:31.753 --> 00:00:34.120
will bring up this window.

1f2d6bff-94a4-4955-92c2-f753961cacc4-0
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.380
Your input features are your
sighting points and for the

1f2d6bff-94a4-4955-92c2-f753961cacc4-1
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.795
relationship we want the same
relationship as we had before so

1f2d6bff-94a4-4955-92c2-f753961cacc4-2
00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:52.953
that's within and our selecting
feature we want to be Ziama

1f2d6bff-94a4-4955-92c2-f753961cacc4-3
00:00:52.953 --> 00:00:57.080
protected area so it's the
points within Ziama.

2ad82a09-1ecf-475b-a781-8b1e11fa2ecc-0
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.970
And selection type, we want a
new selection and we can hit

2ad82a09-1ecf-475b-a781-8b1e11fa2ecc-1
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.960
apply and OK and now we can
export these selected features.

c9e53382-0400-4a1b-a41e-d64e586bed2b-0
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.751
So we will right click on our
sighting points and we will go

c9e53382-0400-4a1b-a41e-d64e586bed2b-1
00:01:16.751 --> 00:01:23.877
down to hover over where it says
data and click Export features

c9e53382-0400-4a1b-a41e-d64e586bed2b-2
00:01:23.877 --> 00:01:27.440
which will bring up this window.

50b45a13-df24-408c-a465-153dfb8a7252-0
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.852
So our input feature are our
points and we've got this blue

50b45a13-df24-408c-a465-153dfb8a7252-1
00:01:33.852 --> 00:01:38.400
text that shows us that this has
the selection on it.

3b405166-1d99-466e-ad18-99646b7e1b78-0
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.320
So now we need to choose where
to save it to.

87b6e2e5-135e-4549-a6ce-4a78e5ed2df6-0
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:55.720
So we will click on the folder
icon here and we're going to

87b6e2e5-135e-4549-a6ce-4a78e5ed2df6-1
00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:05.320
save it into our Hippogriff
Project Geodatabase and we will

87b6e2e5-135e-4549-a6ce-4a78e5ed2df6-2
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.400
name it Ziama Sightings and hit
save.

2b7b88af-abf3-4873-97e2-d993b66ba972-0
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.715
And now we can click OK and in
our contents we can see that we

2b7b88af-abf3-4873-97e2-d993b66ba972-1
00:02:21.715 --> 00:02:24.480
have this layer in it.

0cdafc89-a156-4752-b79d-60909df312aa-0
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.047
So if we turn off the other
sighting points layer, we can

0cdafc89-a156-4752-b79d-60909df312aa-1
00:02:29.047 --> 00:02:33.513
see that our exported layer now
is just the points within Ziama

0cdafc89-a156-4752-b79d-60909df312aa-2
00:02:33.513 --> 00:02:34.560
protected area.

1434f805-3d72-4b5d-a88c-026c7727f8f5-0
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.772
So that's how to select export
selected features in Arc GIS

1434f805-3d72-4b5d-a88c-026c7727f8f5-1
00:02:39.772 --> 00:02:40.080
Pro.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.172
So let's hit save on our project
and now have a go at doing the

bb8d07a9-3157-4372-a0e7-663a8bc09e59-1
00:02:45.172 --> 00:02:49.640
same for Wonegizi Protected Area
and Wologizi Protected Area.
