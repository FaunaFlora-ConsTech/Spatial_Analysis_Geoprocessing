00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.040
Hopefully you've got something
that looks a bit like this now.

a1d77c35-6846-4e9d-8ae3-ba6f53124ea5-0
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.086
So if we look in our layers list
you should have your sighting

a1d77c35-6846-4e9d-8ae3-ba6f53124ea5-1
00:00:13.086 --> 00:00:19.251
points, the three polygons for
the protected areas, the Esri

a1d77c35-6846-4e9d-8ae3-ba6f53124ea5-2
00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:24.809
standard base map, the
Hippogriff sightings table that

a1d77c35-6846-4e9d-8ae3-ba6f53124ea5-3
00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:30.671
we plotted our points from and
hopefully you've added the

a1d77c35-6846-4e9d-8ae3-ba6f53124ea5-4
00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:33.400
environments table as well.

850bf7c6-598f-47d8-b1b6-a1c64c9e7e51-0
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.280
Let's open up this environments
table to have a look at it.

ef799ab8-9137-42c2-972a-251f1cbc628b-0
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.211
So we can see in this table
we've got 3 columns, the first

ef799ab8-9137-42c2-972a-251f1cbc628b-1
00:00:46.211 --> 00:00:51.207
one being our object ID and at
the moment our rows on in

ef799ab8-9137-42c2-972a-251f1cbc628b-2
00:00:51.207 --> 00:00:52.960
chronological order.

a6a730c3-b690-4611-bf62-d0f1fc4e64cb-0
00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.765
So we can just click on the
heading for OID a few times just

a6a730c3-b690-4611-bf62-d0f1fc4e64cb-1
00:00:57.765 --> 00:01:00.680
to get these in chronological
order.

084f7615-bd1d-4fc9-a7fc-5d7d8cc0d6cd-0
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.226
And now if we Scroll down we can
see all of our rows and we've

084f7615-bd1d-4fc9-a7fc-5d7d8cc0d6cd-1
00:01:07.226 --> 00:01:09.280
got 108 different rows.

0aadd17c-db9f-4d52-9ccb-5c50c7f7dbe0-0
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.920
The next column we have is the
unique key.

55ec8717-2181-421b-b4a4-9dd29da5c9af-0
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.895
So if you can remember this is
the same column that we had for

55ec8717-2181-421b-b4a4-9dd29da5c9af-1
00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:20.600
our sighting points data.

454969b3-d122-4f60-9dd5-451ff5081845-0
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.684
We've got a GPS point for each
row, so each sighting has a

454969b3-d122-4f60-9dd5-451ff5081845-1
00:01:26.684 --> 00:01:29.400
unique key for its GPS point.

155f1e84-3bf3-4269-8248-0f97c79123e5-0
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.080
And the third column we have is
the environment.

a15f25fd-6e09-44d4-8d79-61a2377b7847-0
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.570
So we have the different
environments that the sightings

a15f25fd-6e09-44d4-8d79-61a2377b7847-1
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.825
occurred in, like grassland,
secondary forest, primary

a15f25fd-6e09-44d4-8d79-61a2377b7847-2
00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:44.760
forest, village and farm.

99366d14-ed4f-4101-8e5a-91f53be9d539-0
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.160
So now let's take a look at the
table for our sighting points.

0611ae75-5d1e-4c1a-a33d-54ea41241768-0
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.866
So right click and open
Attribute table and we can use

0611ae75-5d1e-4c1a-a33d-54ea41241768-1
00:01:56.866 --> 00:02:02.086
the QGIS tabs at the bottom of
our computer to open up the

0611ae75-5d1e-4c1a-a33d-54ea41241768-2
00:02:02.086 --> 00:02:05.360
environments table at the same
time.

26dc527f-88f1-453c-bd9e-d70f9de79e26-0
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.538
So looking in the points table
we can just organise these again

26dc527f-88f1-453c-bd9e-d70f9de79e26-1
00:02:11.538 --> 00:02:14.240
so they're in chronological
order.

ea2a0b51-ac70-48fd-9738-d34962bc43bf-0
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.706
Just by clicking on the Object
ID column we can see we've got

ea2a0b51-ac70-48fd-9738-d34962bc43bf-1
00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:22.000
these null rows at the top.

4fe108ba-85d9-448c-88ed-f7a96d265567-0
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.760
So let's get rid of these.

8bab73af-409e-4222-9e0d-1799b1ae68d1-0
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.880
Now to do that we need to toggle
editing onto our tables.

6611ec23-ba62-438f-8767-ab4bc4f31e10-0
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.496
So click the little pencil icon
and then we can select the first

6611ec23-ba62-438f-8767-ab4bc4f31e10-1
00:02:34.496 --> 00:02:37.520
row by clicking on the row
number.

bc807ebc-279c-423d-b98f-f687e9aaaba3-0
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.013
Hold down our shift button and
select row number 7 and now this

bc807ebc-279c-423d-b98f-f687e9aaaba3-1
00:02:43.013 --> 00:02:48.146
will highlight all of these null
rows and then we can click the

bc807ebc-279c-423d-b98f-f687e9aaaba3-2
00:02:48.146 --> 00:02:53.120
bin button at the top of the
table to delete these null rows.

5bfdffac-95bf-44f9-80be-3009b5c4bffe-0
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.760
And now we just need to save our
edits.

e140424a-c0db-4906-a57c-21751e29ada3-0
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.349
So click on the save edits
button in the table and toggle

e140424a-c0db-4906-a57c-21751e29ada3-1
00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.800
editing off by clicking on the
pencil icon.

45752bb9-2a7b-4b06-aa9f-2b776db7babc-0
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.473
So in this table we as we
remembered we can see the unique

45752bb9-2a7b-4b06-aa9f-2b776db7babc-1
00:03:11.473 --> 00:03:16.420
key column so we have the GPS
points for each sighting in this

45752bb9-2a7b-4b06-aa9f-2b776db7babc-2
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.520
table as well.

6a0d31c4-b156-4f27-8bda-905f1162c86d-0
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.560
So GPS point one in this table
is the same as GPS point one in

6a0d31c4-b156-4f27-8bda-905f1162c86d-1
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.400
the environments table.

fb28d687-ac34-4359-b402-f333bca8de42-0
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.425
So for GPS point one we can see
where it occurred and we can see

fb28d687-ac34-4359-b402-f333bca8de42-1
00:03:31.425 --> 00:03:35.952
that it was attracts sighting
and now we can also see that it

fb28d687-ac34-4359-b402-f333bca8de42-2
00:03:35.952 --> 00:03:38.800
occurred in the environment
grassland.

6ce1a112-be9f-47ed-96e7-3346ae314b4c-0
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.400
So as this data is related, this
means we can join our

6ce1a112-be9f-47ed-96e7-3346ae314b4c-1
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.680
environment data to our sighting
points so that we have it all in

6ce1a112-be9f-47ed-96e7-3346ae314b4c-2
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.880
the same place.

fc9ad6cc-1db6-40c4-9be8-e1d0246102fe-0
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.040
To do that we're going to add a
join.

a74f4c59-1b2a-4bbc-94b7-47d2e4c9014d-0
00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:02.089
So close the tables, right click
on the sighting points layer and

a74f4c59-1b2a-4bbc-94b7-47d2e4c9014d-1
00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:09.008
go into its properties and now
we can go down to the joins tab

a74f4c59-1b2a-4bbc-94b7-47d2e4c9014d-2
00:04:09.008 --> 00:04:14.720
and we'll use this green plus
button to add a join.

439be705-c03f-4e01-820c-42b1594b06ac-0
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.101
So click on this and this will
bring up the window to put in

439be705-c03f-4e01-820c-42b1594b06ac-1
00:04:19.101 --> 00:04:21.400
our parameters to run this join.

1fb3003e-d9f2-4915-8001-9b771a147047-0
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.766
So our join layer is what table
we want to join to our sighting

1fb3003e-d9f2-4915-8001-9b771a147047-1
00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:27.240
points.

194f55da-2fcd-4e74-b2f2-03a576605489-0
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.782
So this is going to be our
environments table which we've

194f55da-2fcd-4e74-b2f2-03a576605489-1
00:04:31.782 --> 00:04:33.480
already got in this box.

74862b1c-e96a-4ace-a02b-ba41398d137a-0
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.000
And then for the join field and
the Target Field

e1d35d5f-5037-4e39-a1cb-510895233f65-0
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.120
in here we want to put in the
columns which link our data

e1d35d5f-5037-4e39-a1cb-510895233f65-1
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.600
together so we can use the
unique ID column as both our

e1d35d5f-5037-4e39-a1cb-510895233f65-2
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.120
point data and environment table
have this.

8208c629-b5f5-4f35-bb57-5b60ce625664-0
00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:02.886
So in these two boxes, we want
to put in the unique key column

8208c629-b5f5-4f35-bb57-5b60ce625664-1
00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:10.160
and we've got some other boxes
that we can tick on and off

8208c629-b5f5-4f35-bb57-5b60ce625664-2
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:17.803
here, but we're not going to
worry about these apart from the

8208c629-b5f5-4f35-bb57-5b60ce625664-3
00:05:17.803 --> 00:05:19.160
bottom one.

ab2846c8-f103-47d5-bc46-a370b19ef7b9-0
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:26.505
We can toggle it on to change
the name of the data that we're

ab2846c8-f103-47d5-bc46-a370b19ef7b9-1
00:05:26.505 --> 00:05:27.360
joining.

932d4edf-1d8c-4cd7-bb97-6bf246d23881-0
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.714
So we can just call it
environment, we'll click OK,

932d4edf-1d8c-4cd7-bb97-6bf246d23881-1
00:05:33.714 --> 00:05:37.360
we'll click Apply and OK again.

2647f023-0d2e-49d9-a10d-7ce548aa6822-0
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:44.695
And now if we open up the
attribute table for our sighting

2647f023-0d2e-49d9-a10d-7ce548aa6822-1
00:05:44.695 --> 00:05:50.666
points and scroll along to the
right, we can see that we now

2647f023-0d2e-49d9-a10d-7ce548aa6822-2
00:05:50.666 --> 00:05:54.679
have our environments within
this table.

dffa91b1-cd92-453c-b16a-d365b24761e6-0
00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.861
So we've got our GPS point
number one for example, which

dffa91b1-cd92-453c-b16a-d365b24761e6-1
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:05.320
was the sighting of tracks
occurring in the grassland.

35a522e9-8795-46c1-94c5-9b1386d6335f-0
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.955
So to actually save this data
into the layer, we need to

35a522e9-8795-46c1-94c5-9b1386d6335f-1
00:06:15.955 --> 00:06:17.600
export the layer.

10152393-0735-4766-a3e4-f3cccf0ff91d-0
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.641
So we need to right click, go
into export and click save

10152393-0735-4766-a3e4-f3cccf0ff91d-1
00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:23.400
features.

70b8169d-9c32-42dd-9293-8f25db7c6db7-0
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.940
As for the format, we're going
to choose Geo package as this is

70b8169d-9c32-42dd-9293-8f25db7c6db7-1
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.135
going to let us save our layer
into the Geo package that we

70b8169d-9c32-42dd-9293-8f25db7c6db7-2
00:06:34.135 --> 00:06:39.502
created and then we'll choose
where to save it by clicking on

70b8169d-9c32-42dd-9293-8f25db7c6db7-3
00:06:39.502 --> 00:06:41.840
the three little dots icon.

d75f132c-7bc6-454f-ac91-faf77a42c1c5-0
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.360
And in this window we can see
our Geo package.

c1070c83-70ab-45bd-87f9-3bec3bd39862-0
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:53.046
So click on that and below we
can choose the name for our

c1070c83-70ab-45bd-87f9-3bec3bd39862-1
00:06:53.046 --> 00:07:01.660
layer so we can just call it Our
sighting environment points and

c1070c83-70ab-45bd-87f9-3bec3bd39862-2
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:10.009
our coordinate reference system
is the same as what our points

c1070c83-70ab-45bd-87f9-3bec3bd39862-3
00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:11.599
were before.

48e3d41a-4f3a-44f9-8088-dfbb2e8f98ea-0
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.001
So we can leave that how it is
and we don't need to worry about

48e3d41a-4f3a-44f9-8088-dfbb2e8f98ea-1
00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:17.240
the other options.

4ecaa49f-d05a-4663-aeed-a2f6ef03e5f3-0
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.286
So we'll just click OK and now
in our layers list we can see

4ecaa49f-d05a-4663-aeed-a2f6ef03e5f3-1
00:07:22.286 --> 00:07:26.818
that we have a new layer and
this will have the joined data

4ecaa49f-d05a-4663-aeed-a2f6ef03e5f3-2
00:07:26.818 --> 00:07:28.480
saved into this layer.

fbf4011b-da7a-49e7-b2d8-d30d1aac22af-0
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.800
So just remember to hit save to
save your progress.
