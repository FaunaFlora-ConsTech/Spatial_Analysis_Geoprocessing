00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.502
In this video, we're going to be
using the Select Features by

2909ecff-025d-427b-b742-cd9189088f6b-1
00:00:06.502 --> 00:00:11.365
Value tool to see how many of
our sightings occurred in each

2909ecff-025d-427b-b742-cd9189088f6b-2
00:00:11.365 --> 00:00:12.960
type of environment.

92bc8893-9c4a-4507-9185-492640402f81-0
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.304
So the first thing we need to
make sure is to clear any

92bc8893-9c4a-4507-9185-492640402f81-1
00:00:17.304 --> 00:00:19.800
selection we have on our data
already.

b303251a-ec84-47f0-8aa3-872be453c02b-0
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.349
So we'll go into the selection
toolbar and click on the

b303251a-ec84-47f0-8aa3-872be453c02b-1
00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.522
Deselect button and now the
button that we want to use to

b303251a-ec84-47f0-8aa3-872be453c02b-2
00:00:28.522 --> 00:00:32.840
select our features by a value
is the button to the left of

b303251a-ec84-47f0-8aa3-872be453c02b-3
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:33.199
this.

97d240ea-2c3f-4047-9c8a-ba455a782593-0
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.549
But before we click on it, we
just want to make sure that we

97d240ea-2c3f-4047-9c8a-ba455a782593-1
00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:41.400
have our Sightings layer
selected in the layers list.

312afcb7-8adb-4bc4-81db-3af78d00e05f-0
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.252
And now we can click on the
Select features by Value button

312afcb7-8adb-4bc4-81db-3af78d00e05f-1
00:00:45.252 --> 00:00:47.200
which will bring up this window.

d825cefe-b35a-4744-9f62-7b40e9c12518-0
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.718
And so this shows all the
columns that we have in our

d825cefe-b35a-4744-9f62-7b40e9c12518-1
00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:52.880
sightings table.

c811b0b6-5bd4-4c94-9bee-af2d8b0d2b87-0
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.440
We're interested in the bottom
one, the environment.

c3a64342-5083-4af9-b69a-7dbbd334485c-0
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.023
And So what we need to change is
this button to the right hand

c3a64342-5083-4af9-b69a-7dbbd334485c-1
00:01:02.023 --> 00:01:03.600
side that says exclude field.

4fa3686a-d54d-4b8f-ba79-bbab4c17714b-0
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.439
This is what all of the
different column headings say at

4fa3686a-d54d-4b8f-ba79-bbab4c17714b-1
00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.880
the moment because none of our
data is selected.

77304cae-6872-4141-9988-a3e8d2add0ac-0
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.991
So we're going to click on this
one for the environment and

77304cae-6872-4141-9988-a3e8d2add0ac-1
00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:13.000
change it to equal to.

bfd68e49-b5d7-4cdb-a736-a28854b5da6a-0
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.895
And now in the box that we can
type in, we can type in what

bfd68e49-b5d7-4cdb-a736-a28854b5da6a-1
00:01:17.895 --> 00:01:20.840
environment we want to select
the data for.

6bf6a489-526d-4ffe-aad2-3dd74bded8a1-0
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.324
So if we look for farm, we can
just type an F and now we can

6bf6a489-526d-4ffe-aad2-3dd74bded8a1-1
00:01:25.324 --> 00:01:27.200
see that it brings up farms.

1e8aa2a7-b2ab-4bdf-afe1-5c002b52748e-0
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.275
So we'll click on this and now
we can click on the Select

1e8aa2a7-b2ab-4bdf-afe1-5c002b52748e-1
00:01:31.275 --> 00:01:32.400
Features button.

125a896d-9f7f-4039-9982-3ed7df32ef7c-0
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.309
And so if we shut this window
now, we can see on our map that

125a896d-9f7f-4039-9982-3ed7df32ef7c-1
00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:43.437
some of the points are
highlighted, some of the data

125a896d-9f7f-4039-9982-3ed7df32ef7c-2
00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:44.840
has been selected.

150a5597-1a07-4f45-87f4-2e19fbacc8d2-0
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.412
So now we can go and open up the
attribute table for our

150a5597-1a07-4f45-87f4-2e19fbacc8d2-1
00:01:49.412 --> 00:01:53.647
sightings layer to see the rows
that have been selected and how

150a5597-1a07-4f45-87f4-2e19fbacc8d2-2
00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:54.640
many there are.

275e51b2-9e53-47d1-9f76-36e7de945159-0
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.731
So like we did in the last
video, we can look at the top of

275e51b2-9e53-47d1-9f76-36e7de945159-1
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:12.060
the table and it tells us that
10 points are selected.

d75b563d-ad34-4ab7-87d2-ceead5c8ced2-0
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.820
So we know that 10 sightings
occurred within farmland.

7d98df56-50ed-4a43-87bb-94b58ff41e92-0
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.969
And again, we can move the
selected rows to the top and

7d98df56-50ed-4a43-87bb-94b58ff41e92-1
00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:25.411
just to check our selection, we
can scroll across on our table

7d98df56-50ed-4a43-87bb-94b58ff41e92-2
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:29.361
and we can see all of the of
these selected points have

7d98df56-50ed-4a43-87bb-94b58ff41e92-3
00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:30.560
occurred in farm.

855cf20d-9d8c-4472-a04e-62412820fb67-0
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.504
And so now have a go at doing
the same thing for the different

855cf20d-9d8c-4472-a04e-62412820fb67-1
00:02:35.504 --> 00:02:39.427
types of environment and writing
down how many sightings occurred

855cf20d-9d8c-4472-a04e-62412820fb67-2
00:02:39.427 --> 00:02:40.200
in each type.

dd6cafab-e2ad-4f9c-a7bc-fff19d6d1e36-0
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.914
And just remember each time to
deselect the selected features

dd6cafab-e2ad-4f9c-a7bc-fff19d6d1e36-1
00:02:44.914 --> 00:02:47.280
before you run your next
selection.
