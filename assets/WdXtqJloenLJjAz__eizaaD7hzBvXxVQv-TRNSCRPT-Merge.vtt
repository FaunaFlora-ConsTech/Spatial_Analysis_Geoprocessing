43b93f71-327e-4edd-bd12-112b2cedbec1-0
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.857
In this video we're going to be
using the merge tool, but first

43b93f71-327e-4edd-bd12-112b2cedbec1-1
00:00:06.857 --> 00:00:12.360
of all, let's just clean up our
layers list so we can remove the

43b93f71-327e-4edd-bd12-112b2cedbec1-2
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.000
spawning grounds layer that
isn't clipped.

350ba34c-5ecb-4caf-b065-cfda9cccef20-0
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.852
So we'll click on this, right
click and click remove layer and

350ba34c-5ecb-4caf-b065-cfda9cccef20-1
00:00:22.852 --> 00:00:27.891
we can also toggle off the
territorial sea layer as we

350ba34c-5ecb-4caf-b065-cfda9cccef20-2
00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:30.640
don't need this at the moment.

ddbf7239-e2d6-4e9b-bd41-9a6a1b83e2f6-0
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.412
And so in this video we're going
to be merging the MPA no Take

ddbf7239-e2d6-4e9b-bd41-9a6a1b83e2f6-1
00:00:38.412 --> 00:00:41.920
layer with the spawning clips
layer.

067789e9-e7fb-46bb-9cca-e4c80fd11e5c-0
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.505
And this is because the purple
Polygon we can see for the MPA

067789e9-e7fb-46bb-9cca-e4c80fd11e5c-1
00:00:46.505 --> 00:00:50.487
no take is the current no Take
zone that's around Tristina

067789e9-e7fb-46bb-9cca-e4c80fd11e5c-2
00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:50.960
Island.

a4478bcb-f2c6-40df-b7db-90bc303cf4b5-0
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.246
The clipped spawning grounds we
want to create as a no take zone

a4478bcb-f2c6-40df-b7db-90bc303cf4b5-1
00:00:56.246 --> 00:01:00.612
during the spawning seasons and
so we want to merge these layers

a4478bcb-f2c6-40df-b7db-90bc303cf4b5-2
00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:04.978
so that we can create a map that
shows the no take zones for the

a4478bcb-f2c6-40df-b7db-90bc303cf4b5-3
00:01:04.978 --> 00:01:06.119
spawning seasons.

0c0821f4-35e9-45e7-84f2-a08bc443ca16-0
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.072
Just a note to make here, the
merge tool is similar to the

0c0821f4-35e9-45e7-84f2-a08bc443ca16-1
00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:14.080
union tool, but there are some
differences.

f0cc45de-4ca6-4b6e-a4c0-517845e3fd14-0
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.768
So both tools will merge the
features of two layers together,

f0cc45de-4ca6-4b6e-a4c0-517845e3fd14-1
00:01:19.768 --> 00:01:25.103
but the Union tool creates a new
features for where the polygons

f0cc45de-4ca6-4b6e-a4c0-517845e3fd14-2
00:01:25.103 --> 00:01:25.760
overlap.

d1001327-5dae-4a2a-8857-6572ea1c42bf-0
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.692
We're not interested in where
the polygons overlap as we just

d1001327-5dae-4a2a-8857-6572ea1c42bf-1
00:01:29.692 --> 00:01:32.280
want to merge this all into one,
no take zone.

655f38d4-2329-4654-a20b-2260afbac260-0
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.680
And so Merge is the tool that we
want to use in this video.

ded4c558-7944-4f68-9cd7-8a15c45c2a2a-0
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.420
So let's go into the processing
toolbox and search Merge, and

ded4c558-7944-4f68-9cd7-8a15c45c2a2a-1
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.560
the tool that we want is Merge
Vector Layers.

7b2136f9-b219-4ace-a4ee-49556ae4846e-0
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:54.719
So we're going to click on this,
and this tool is fairly easy to

7b2136f9-b219-4ace-a4ee-49556ae4846e-1
00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:55.160
run.

204c0f01-5e76-441b-9c46-1f3148fcbfa9-0
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.286
We just need to choose what
layers we're merging together in

204c0f01-5e76-441b-9c46-1f3148fcbfa9-1
00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.200
this Input Layers section here.

ccc5a9d7-b05c-4499-967a-4a0b0bd5fd1d-0
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:11.501
So let's click on the three
little dots button next to this

ccc5a9d7-b05c-4499-967a-4a0b0bd5fd1d-1
00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:20.056
section and here we can toggle
on which layers we want to merge

ccc5a9d7-b05c-4499-967a-4a0b0bd5fd1d-2
00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:21.260
together.

885491e8-3135-4651-a256-1a6b9cd9c129-0
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.217
And so that's the MPA no take
layer and the spawning clipped

885491e8-3135-4651-a256-1a6b9cd9c129-1
00:02:26.217 --> 00:02:30.458
layer and then we'll click OK
and now in the Input layer

885491e8-3135-4651-a256-1a6b9cd9c129-2
00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:34.549
section we can see we have two
layers selected for the

885491e8-3135-4651-a256-1a6b9cd9c129-3
00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.600
Coordinate reference system
destination.

3eb9d26f-3e86-478e-95d6-e35d3aa65f97-0
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.998
All of our data layers and our
map are in the UTM zone 21 N.

3eb9d26f-3e86-478e-95d6-e35d3aa65f97-1
00:02:42.998 --> 00:02:47.993
And so if we click on this drop
down arrow here, we can see

3eb9d26f-3e86-478e-95d6-e35d3aa65f97-2
00:02:47.993 --> 00:02:51.240
that's the first option that
comes up.

b240d2d8-4ced-4929-90f9-9ab10a6fa580-0
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.360
And so we can just click on that
here.

713c23b4-3ce7-4fbb-a3f1-3fbce4079b42-0
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.650
And now under merge, this is
where we choose where to save

713c23b4-3ce7-4fbb-a3f1-3fbce4079b42-1
00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.400
the new layer that's going to be
created into.

a8bd0e85-69f5-4900-ad11-6576bf788ec5-0
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.498
So we'll click on the three
little dots next to this and

a8bd0e85-69f5-4900-ad11-6576bf788ec5-1
00:03:04.498 --> 00:03:06.240
choose save to Geopackage.

52ca13bf-0e18-45b7-ad21-927794dd14c2-0
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.965
And now navigate to your project
folder and find the Geopackage

52ca13bf-0e18-45b7-ad21-927794dd14c2-1
00:03:10.965 --> 00:03:13.200
that we created in the last
video.

5e34650d-1392-42d6-9e3f-47be970d8a9e-0
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.134
So we'll go into this and now we
can choose the name of the layer

5e34650d-1392-42d6-9e3f-47be970d8a9e-1
00:03:19.134 --> 00:03:20.800
that we're creating.

430e4870-fc6e-46c1-95c9-7c34347fe0b5-0
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.083
So we can name it No Take
Spawning Season and click OK and

430e4870-fc6e-46c1-95c9-7c34347fe0b5-1
00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:34.000
then run the tool.

2c4f7e5d-2429-49b4-a151-91821d9007a7-0
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.055
So once it's run we can shut the
window and let's turn off the

2c4f7e5d-2429-49b4-a151-91821d9007a7-1
00:03:45.055 --> 00:03:51.111
layers that we merged so the MPA
no take zone and the spawning

2c4f7e5d-2429-49b4-a151-91821d9007a7-2
00:03:51.111 --> 00:03:51.880
clipped.

26c155e2-8c13-424a-88f0-535883fa5340-0
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.381
And now we can look just at the
new merged layer and so we can

26c155e2-8c13-424a-88f0-535883fa5340-1
00:03:57.381 --> 00:04:02.165
see that the merge tool has
merged the spawning grounds with

26c155e2-8c13-424a-88f0-535883fa5340-2
00:04:02.165 --> 00:04:04.440
the current no take MPA zone.

549267eb-4710-4f21-8691-352a120ec039-0
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.745
So let's have a look at the
attribute table of our merged

549267eb-4710-4f21-8691-352a120ec039-1
00:04:09.745 --> 00:04:10.120
layer.

a38e4b4c-a424-4026-9513-261ad3f947a6-0
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.348
So we'll right click and open up
the attribute table, and we can

a38e4b4c-a424-4026-9513-261ad3f947a6-1
00:04:14.348 --> 00:04:18.137
see that there's four rows in
this table representing the four

a38e4b4c-a424-4026-9513-261ad3f947a6-2
00:04:18.137 --> 00:04:19.279
different polygons.

8b855ddf-7666-4258-ae48-6d259dde33b4-0
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.848
So we can highlight each row to
see that the layer has the four

8b855ddf-7666-4258-ae48-6d259dde33b4-1
00:04:29.848 --> 00:04:36.080
polygons inside, and so that's
how to run the merge tool in

8b855ddf-7666-4258-ae48-6d259dde33b4-2
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.599
QGIS.

5af4425f-ee65-4e4e-93c6-a7063fe74be4-0
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.440
So just remember to hit save to
save your progress.
