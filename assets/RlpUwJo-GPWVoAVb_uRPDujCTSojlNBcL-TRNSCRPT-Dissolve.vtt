00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.760
In this video we're going to be
using the Dissolve tool.

90419f12-ea22-43d3-a587-13a697acae27-0
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.102
The dissolve tool can dissolve
the boundaries between features

90419f12-ea22-43d3-a587-13a697acae27-1
00:00:12.102 --> 00:00:17.651
within a layer and it can also
dissolve the boundaries based on

90419f12-ea22-43d3-a587-13a697acae27-2
00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:20.600
the attributes of those
features.

8b06d89d-3a4f-4494-8230-be44b8cf7843-0
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.413
So within our merged data set,
we can see that where the

8b06d89d-3a4f-4494-8230-be44b8cf7843-1
00:00:25.413 --> 00:00:29.944
spawning grounds and the current
no take MPA zone overlap, we've

8b06d89d-3a4f-4494-8230-be44b8cf7843-2
00:00:29.944 --> 00:00:33.360
got some boundaries, some lines
in between them.

c9a24ed6-1f8b-4aed-a3ae-afef6b69edcc-0
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.480


6fee4d08-8034-4945-872e-06996824fa86-0
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.426
And we don't want this as we
want it to be all merged

6fee4d08-8034-4945-872e-06996824fa86-1
00:00:38.426 --> 00:00:41.646
together so that we can see
where the no take zone will be

6fee4d08-8034-4945-872e-06996824fa86-2
00:00:41.646 --> 00:00:43.120
during the spawning months.

ef61eb01-eab4-44d3-8c3c-58c07e732c8a-0
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.960
So let's open up the Dissolve
tool.

40b47ac5-d3d4-4483-91be-b5393ddadb73-0
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.047
We'll type it into the
Geoprocessing window and open it

40b47ac5-d3d4-4483-91be-b5393ddadb73-1
00:00:55.047 --> 00:00:55.320
up.

409f6911-4fe9-411e-b97c-f4f716a54951-0
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.360
Our input feature is just the
merged layer that we created.

151b71ab-6687-4485-8195-079b6fabe094-0
00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.124
We'll drag that in and now we
can choose where we want to save

151b71ab-6687-4485-8195-079b6fabe094-1
00:01:09.124 --> 00:01:15.624
the new layer that's going to be
created and what we want to name

151b71ab-6687-4485-8195-079b6fabe094-2
00:01:15.624 --> 00:01:15.920
it.

d2ed3fdf-8e92-401e-880e-fcaf6d678e81-0
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.702
So we'll make sure it's going
into our Geodatabase and we'll

d2ed3fdf-8e92-401e-880e-fcaf6d678e81-1
00:01:23.702 --> 00:01:29.480
name it something like spawning
months no take.

1226ee99-6c67-4bd1-b2f9-da888c8ed7ac-0
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.640
So we know it's the no take zone
during the spawning months.

704dd141-4605-4b5a-bf05-e484d231fe22-0
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.320
And in the dissolve tool, you
could also set dissolve fields.

de36f90c-0061-40a2-bd19-65123abe9094-0
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.281
And so these are the columns or
the attributes within a layer

de36f90c-0061-40a2-bd19-65123abe9094-1
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:51.180
that we can use to tell the tool
where to dissolve the

de36f90c-0061-40a2-bd19-65123abe9094-2
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.160
boundaries.

179663fc-81b9-4978-ae20-17f4d2a8d216-0
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.131
So this isn't relevant for our
layer because we just want to

179663fc-81b9-4978-ae20-17f4d2a8d216-1
00:01:57.131 --> 00:02:01.045
dissolve all the boundaries or
any boundary that's in between

179663fc-81b9-4978-ae20-17f4d2a8d216-2
00:02:01.045 --> 00:02:03.760
the no take zone and the
spawning grounds.

b31d4f21-13e4-4f3b-b5f3-93d9484e0e9a-0
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.017
But if you had a layer for
example that was a continent,

b31d4f21-13e4-4f3b-b5f3-93d9484e0e9a-1
00:02:08.017 --> 00:02:12.147
and then you had the boundaries
for the countries and you also

b31d4f21-13e4-4f3b-b5f3-93d9484e0e9a-2
00:02:12.147 --> 00:02:15.885
had the boundaries for the
regions within the countries,

b31d4f21-13e4-4f3b-b5f3-93d9484e0e9a-3
00:02:15.885 --> 00:02:19.360
but you didn't want the regional
boundaries anymore.

eb534cbd-2ac6-4c67-8742-928520f58179-0
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.324
Then you would need a column
within the table for the data

eb534cbd-2ac6-4c67-8742-928520f58179-1
00:02:25.324 --> 00:02:29.120
that tells you what country each
region is in.

ced5638f-b215-4016-8d09-8f46ce82554f-0
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.441
And you could use this column
within this dissolve fields to

ced5638f-b215-4016-8d09-8f46ce82554f-1
00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:39.032
tell the dissolve tool to
dissolve the boundaries where

ced5638f-b215-4016-8d09-8f46ce82554f-2
00:02:39.032 --> 00:02:41.000
the country is the same.

161fe65b-2165-4c43-864f-ee9caf994b8e-0
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.309
So all the regions in the same
country and it would dissolve

161fe65b-2165-4c43-864f-ee9caf994b8e-1
00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:46.160
these for us.

d1a08539-e037-4a95-a629-0ee2d7f350c9-0
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.018
We just want to dissolve these
couple boundaries here where the

d1a08539-e037-4a95-a629-0ee2d7f350c9-1
00:02:51.018 --> 00:02:53.600
spawning grounds are
overlapping.

c29122d0-a176-4a27-9190-92cfecdbb9a5-0
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.157
If we don't set a dissolve field
then ArcGIS Pro just

c29122d0-a176-4a27-9190-92cfecdbb9a5-1
00:02:57.157 --> 00:03:00.532
automatically dissolves all
boundaries between the features

c29122d0-a176-4a27-9190-92cfecdbb9a5-2
00:03:00.532 --> 00:03:01.320
in that layer.

70f62016-d82a-4f61-bed5-bc966217fd84-0
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.694
So we can just run the tool how
it is and then this is going to

70f62016-d82a-4f61-bed5-bc966217fd84-1
00:03:05.694 --> 00:03:10.082
create this new data layer where
we can see those boundaries have

70f62016-d82a-4f61-bed5-bc966217fd84-2
00:03:10.082 --> 00:03:11.080
been dissolved.

41fba878-e89d-41d1-9f63-906d56eb2b93-0
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.680
And so that's how to run the
dissolve tool in Arcgis Pro.

edd9b57c-8fac-4183-816d-030adf1a92a1-0
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.200
So just remember to hit the save
button.
