d2fe2c89-13e1-44ef-9388-cf5739f5ef76-0
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.218
In this video we're going to be
running the Union tool and we're

d2fe2c89-13e1-44ef-9388-cf5739f5ef76-1
00:00:06.218 --> 00:00:10.814
going to be creating the union
between the spawning grounds

d2fe2c89-13e1-44ef-9388-cf5739f5ef76-2
00:00:10.814 --> 00:00:15.640
layer (the proposed no take zone
layer) and the fishing ground

d2fe2c89-13e1-44ef-9388-cf5739f5ef76-3
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.240
layer that hopefully you have in
your map now.

4d4de8cf-b6df-4c70-b84a-25d182dd2aa4-0
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.727
So the reason why we're running
the Union tool is because Union

4d4de8cf-b6df-4c70-b84a-25d182dd2aa4-1
00:00:25.727 --> 00:00:31.011
tool, unlike the Merge tool, it
will join the layers together,

4d4de8cf-b6df-4c70-b84a-25d182dd2aa4-2
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:35.875
but it will also create new
polygons for where the layers

4d4de8cf-b6df-4c70-b84a-25d182dd2aa4-3
00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:41.326
overlap and we're interested in
where these overlaps are and how

4d4de8cf-b6df-4c70-b84a-25d182dd2aa4-4
00:00:41.326 --> 00:00:45.520
much the fishing ground is going
to be reduced by

0b68e2e1-6a0a-48af-b601-ce67991da1c2-0
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.338
with this no take zone as we can
only reduce it by a maximum of

0b68e2e1-6a0a-48af-b601-ce67991da1c2-1
00:00:50.338 --> 00:00:50.640
25%.

a4d3b13e-e013-4499-89e0-4e6b9e2bc58f-0
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.700
So first of all, let's just
clean up our contents and remove

a4d3b13e-e013-4499-89e0-4e6b9e2bc58f-1
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.520
any layers we don't need.

73d2db0c-79b7-4346-a65b-cc0d913821c1-0
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.656
We don't need this previous
spawning months layer, so we can

73d2db0c-79b7-4346-a65b-cc0d913821c1-1
00:01:07.656 --> 00:01:12.000
remove that and just have the
spawning months erased layer.

abf9842a-4bcf-4d41-ac36-b018aa81f811-0
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.660
And now let's go ahead and open
up the geoprocessing toolbox and

abf9842a-4bcf-4d41-ac36-b018aa81f811-1
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.144
we want to type in Union in the
search bar and click on the

abf9842a-4bcf-4d41-ac36-b018aa81f811-2
00:01:25.144 --> 00:01:29.440
first tool that comes up that
just says Union.

9d72c237-29fa-4e30-963e-2ece865ed12a-0
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.859
So our input features are going
to be the layers that we're

9d72c237-29fa-4e30-963e-2ece865ed12a-1
00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:34.840
joining together.

edf21008-7b95-4cd7-9d0f-fcc176dfb3b6-0
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.116
And so that's the spawning
grounds layer and the fishing

edf21008-7b95-4cd7-9d0f-fcc176dfb3b6-1
00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:38.480
ground.

789f95f5-b3ac-4659-8497-674ca3498772-0
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.341
And so we can drag these into
this section here. You can click

789f95f5-b3ac-4659-8497-674ca3498772-1
00:01:43.341 --> 00:01:46.995
on the fishing ground layer,
hold control and click on the

789f95f5-b3ac-4659-8497-674ca3498772-2
00:01:46.995 --> 00:01:50.958
spawning months erase layer at
the same time and then drag them

789f95f5-b3ac-4659-8497-674ca3498772-3
00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.559
across into where it says input
features.

449691bc-fcd3-4f1a-ac11-9600807d1f86-0
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.760
So now we can see we've got them
both here.

9da0da96-6eb7-4029-ace1-a6a6f9108205-0
00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.532
The next thing we need to do is
choose where to save this and

9da0da96-6eb7-4029-ace1-a6a6f9108205-1
00:02:01.532 --> 00:02:02.320
what to name it.

2da7de77-2666-49ba-be7d-3a3b85efcf2f-0
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:12.670
So like usual, we're going to go
into our Geodatabase and we'll

2da7de77-2666-49ba-be7d-3a3b85efcf2f-1
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.920
name it Fishing, spawning Union,
and hit save.

f624203d-4a06-48f3-8077-91de5940163d-0
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.327
And now this section here we can
choose what information in the

f624203d-4a06-48f3-8077-91de5940163d-1
00:02:26.327 --> 00:02:30.603
layers' attribute tables we want
in the new layer, that it's

f624203d-4a06-48f3-8077-91de5940163d-2
00:02:30.603 --> 00:02:34.600
going to create in the attribute
table of the new layer.

a3a657fe-ba9d-421e-bf58-e85fcc3dc858-0
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.786
And so we're going to choose all
attributes just to keep all of

a3a657fe-ba9d-421e-bf58-e85fcc3dc858-1
00:02:38.786 --> 00:02:39.760
that information.

b353fe62-d4b7-40e1-a531-33608779d8cc-0
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:48.123
And then we'll hit run and now
we can see it's loaded in our

b353fe62-d4b7-40e1-a531-33608779d8cc-1
00:02:48.123 --> 00:02:48.640
map.

bea351a2-bf8d-4d7b-8bd4-368ae99dc403-0
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.014
So let's just turn off the
original 2 layers, toggle them

bea351a2-bf8d-4d7b-8bd4-368ae99dc403-1
00:02:53.014 --> 00:02:57.766
off and just take a look at this
new layer we've created so we

bea351a2-bf8d-4d7b-8bd4-368ae99dc403-2
00:02:57.766 --> 00:03:02.217
can see that it's merged these
or it's joined these layers

bea351a2-bf8d-4d7b-8bd4-368ae99dc403-3
00:03:02.217 --> 00:03:06.667
together and we can also see the
boundaries in between the

bea351a2-bf8d-4d7b-8bd4-368ae99dc403-4
00:03:06.667 --> 00:03:09.759
fishing ground and the spawning
grounds.

a5762a8a-1e6c-419a-84a9-cde5a920f7f5-0
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.880
Let's open up the attribute
table for this new layer.

e3550b59-08f6-4a80-b867-94a6434805b7-0
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.970
And here in the attribute table
we can see that we've got rows

e3550b59-08f6-4a80-b867-94a6434805b7-1
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.880
for three polygons.

89ca8aec-ad86-4f47-a322-8db4e030397a-0
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.482
So if we highlight each row, we
can take a look at what polygons

89ca8aec-ad86-4f47-a322-8db4e030397a-1
00:03:32.482 --> 00:03:33.840
they're representing.

ea63f7fe-63da-49fe-9ca3-33da2500a9f9-0
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.991
So we can see this first Polygon
is the fishing ground but minus

ea63f7fe-63da-49fe-9ca3-33da2500a9f9-1
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:46.160
the overlapping section.

3cf590fa-bb2a-4d66-8a0f-f068b2087085-0
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.656
The 2nd Polygon is the proposed
no take zone but again minus the

3cf590fa-bb2a-4d66-8a0f-f068b2087085-1
00:03:52.656 --> 00:03:57.256
overlapping section and the
third Polygon is just the

3cf590fa-bb2a-4d66-8a0f-f068b2087085-2
00:03:57.256 --> 00:03:58.959
overlapping section.

dea079d9-f2f3-495e-800a-567b63275a92-0
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.932
So what we want to do is
calculate the area of this

dea079d9-f2f3-495e-800a-567b63275a92-1
00:04:05.932 --> 00:04:10.525
overlap so that we can see how
much the fishing ground would be

dea079d9-f2f3-495e-800a-567b63275a92-2
00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:14.760
reduced by if we kept the
proposed no take zone like this.

42c2a9ba-789a-4788-a0f0-74bc680b5c46-0
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.400
So we need to calculate area to
be able to do this.

bbb84da1-8a7c-43a7-b4c4-9ae032eb87f2-0
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.251
We already have a column for
area, but we don't know what

bbb84da1-8a7c-43a7-b4c4-9ae032eb87f2-1
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:27.240
units it's in and we don't know
when it was calculated.

611e3c5a-006d-42a6-ac0d-f982a3f035eb-0
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.448
So we'll just calculate a new
field so we know that we're

611e3c5a-006d-42a6-ac0d-f982a3f035eb-1
00:04:30.448 --> 00:04:32.440
getting the right area
calculation.

4fe0473c-3be2-4a09-8161-d7059b739cf6-0
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.547
So we'll do this how we did it
in the previous lessons For

4fe0473c-3be2-4a09-8161-d7059b739cf6-1
00:04:37.547 --> 00:04:38.720
spatial analysis.

58cdb3ef-1a3c-4489-9e91-4c4d0f4a09fe-0
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.304
We're going to add a new field
by using this button here, which

58cdb3ef-1a3c-4489-9e91-4c4d0f4a09fe-1
00:04:45.304 --> 00:04:49.120
is going to bring up this table
window.

6f6c518d-ae5f-425f-93c0-1e61cc833c38-0
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.862
So our new column is this row at
the bottom, so we can name it,

6f6c518d-ae5f-425f-93c0-1e61cc833c38-1
00:04:57.862 --> 00:05:03.520
so we'll name it area and give
the alias area as well.

5e9b5b1c-1508-4fcd-aa79-87fdc97df5b6-0
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.989
The data type is going to be
double as we want a number with

5e9b5b1c-1508-4fcd-aa79-87fdc97df5b6-1
00:05:07.989 --> 00:05:09.000
decimal places.

1688a70d-54d5-4d0f-ad3a-380a3b9ffa12-0
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.589
The number format we're going to
have as numeric and we'll reduce

1688a70d-54d5-4d0f-ad3a-380a3b9ffa12-1
00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:21.177
these decimal places down to two
and click OK and then we can

1688a70d-54d5-4d0f-ad3a-380a3b9ffa12-2
00:05:21.177 --> 00:05:26.585
save our changes using this
button at the top here as we're

1688a70d-54d5-4d0f-ad3a-380a3b9ffa12-3
00:05:26.585 --> 00:05:29.199
in the fields tab at the top.

61679c7a-9241-4124-b8db-34a0f9e1a147-0
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.810
This is what happened when we
opened up the table, it put us

61679c7a-9241-4124-b8db-34a0f9e1a147-1
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.800
in this Fields tab
automatically.

a6c11fa0-bcb1-416b-acd2-fdb7f75e92a6-0
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.680
Now we can shut this and we've
got our column for Area.

206e5da7-2557-4a46-b709-b8069de0c98b-0
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.880
So let's calculate the geometry.

5c95a738-c915-4847-9166-f85599a2d05d-0
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.548
So right click on the heading,
the column heading, choose

5c95a738-c915-4847-9166-f85599a2d05d-1
00:05:45.548 --> 00:05:46.920
Calculate geometry.

ebbbb785-a60c-41d7-ac3a-7d2fc94b37c9-0
00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.720
Our input feature is already put
there, so that's fine.

89b4c16f-6b58-4b24-a62a-4e59a07d7f56-0
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.110
We just need to put in the
property as area and the field

89b4c16f-6b58-4b24-a62a-4e59a07d7f56-1
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.600
as area.

940aee10-f7fc-4b94-a863-4c27d0f8e1ff-0
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.773
The area unit is square
kilometers and the coordinate

940aee10-f7fc-4b94-a863-4c27d0f8e1ff-1
00:06:01.773 --> 00:06:02.320
system,

c62ac9ec-fe4f-4001-b0b9-784f2cb6e5dd-0
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.687
we can put this as the current
layer, although our layers and

c62ac9ec-fe4f-4001-b0b9-784f2cb6e5dd-1
00:06:05.687 --> 00:06:08.999
our map are all in the same
coordinate system, so it doesn't

c62ac9ec-fe4f-4001-b0b9-784f2cb6e5dd-2
00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.760
really matter.

b513b416-eb7d-47e8-9e96-e6f4235adf79-0
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:18.035
And then hit run and now we've
calculated the area, so for the

b513b416-eb7d-47e8-9e96-e6f4235adf79-1
00:06:18.035 --> 00:06:22.200
overlapping area it's 14.48km
^2.

3269c313-3c50-4d57-9313-16f655c7aa37-0
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.412
Now we need to know the area of
the fishing ground, so we're

3269c313-3c50-4d57-9313-16f655c7aa37-1
00:06:27.412 --> 00:06:30.760
going to open up the attribute
table for this layer.

a198ff46-47be-4faf-a01a-47d6cebbea00-0
00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.080
We're going to add a new field
like we just did.

205dde84-a0d3-43dd-90b8-f4752ce220c1-0
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.572
Again, we'll put in the field
name and the alias area, the

205dde84-a0d3-43dd-90b8-f4752ce220c1-1
00:06:47.572 --> 00:06:55.144
data type as double, and the
number format as numeric with

205dde84-a0d3-43dd-90b8-f4752ce220c1-2
00:06:55.144 --> 00:07:00.919
two decimal places, and then
we'll hit save.

f67a1d10-c64c-421c-9086-cc54ade5a650-0
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.840
Shut this box and now we can
calculate the area in here.

d341dbad-58d6-4467-9c23-e1db724d5546-0
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.320
So we'll bring up the Calculate
Geometry window.

b91bd124-c8ee-4754-b168-1d410d73af3d-0
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.680
We've got the fishing ground
here.

f325a537-4faa-466a-9427-e1bab1a7d31a-0
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.147
The field is area, the property
is area, area units, square

f325a537-4faa-466a-9427-e1bab1a7d31a-1
00:07:21.147 --> 00:07:24.520
kilometers, and the coordinate
system,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:32.224
again, we can choose our layer
for this and we'll click, OK, so

006f2da8-67bc-4dc6-a246-469a0ac66118-1
00:07:32.224 --> 00:07:38.511
now we've got our area
calculation and so now we can do

006f2da8-67bc-4dc6-a246-469a0ac66118-2
00:07:38.511 --> 00:07:45.247
the calculation to see what
percentage of the total fishing

006f2da8-67bc-4dc6-a246-469a0ac66118-3
00:07:45.247 --> 00:07:52.320
ground area would be taken away
by this proposed no take zone.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:01.717
So let's bring up the calculator
and now we can just do our

6d87531b-98ab-462a-9e98-bdb62f404c8f-1
00:08:01.717 --> 00:08:04.440
simple calculation.

b2faade8-c429-4b36-98bc-ff3b28ed420b-0
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:11.697
So the area of the intersecting
areas divided by the total

b2faade8-c429-4b36-98bc-ff3b28ed420b-1
00:08:11.697 --> 00:08:15.880
fishing ground area times by
100.

39f98e87-b7af-410b-99d2-1cd963ff19af-0
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:25.160
And so we know that the fishing
ground would be reduced by 21%.

a7fe783d-d0cb-4439-a1a8-73a01a9fee0c-0
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.510
This is below the 25% maximum
and so we can go ahead with this

a7fe783d-d0cb-4439-a1a8-73a01a9fee0c-1
00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:35.497
proposed no take zone for the
spawning season and that's how

a7fe783d-d0cb-4439-a1a8-73a01a9fee0c-2
00:08:35.497 --> 00:08:38.440
to run a Union tool in Arc GIS
Pro.
