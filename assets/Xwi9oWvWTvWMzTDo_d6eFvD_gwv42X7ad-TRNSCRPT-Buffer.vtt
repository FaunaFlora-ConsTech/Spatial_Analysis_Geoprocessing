4bcb5849-0ae4-4267-b989-18d335a49f1c-0
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.365
In this video we're going to be
using the buffer tool, so let's

4bcb5849-0ae4-4267-b989-18d335a49f1c-1
00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:10.386
just make sure we have the
layers that we need in our

4bcb5849-0ae4-4267-b989-18d335a49f1c-2
00:00:10.386 --> 00:00:11.280
layers list.

53f4ab8a-3b6b-4fd1-9aa9-8736600252fd-0
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.683
So first of all, we can get rid
of the proposed no take zone for

53f4ab8a-3b6b-4fd1-9aa9-8736600252fd-1
00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:23.200
the spawning months that doesn't
have the boundaries dissolved.

bd3e11de-80a8-42a7-9f6d-3c9e0bf53268-0
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.600
So it's this pink one here.

56686074-4976-499e-a38b-d5eaf2f99172-0
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.720
So we're going to remove that.

c705c711-38c5-497c-92de-c104769475fb-0
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.400
So let's right click and click
remove.

daf9a3b3-e8e2-4d4f-aff2-b0f555f26884-0
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.195
And then we also need to make
sure that we've added in this

daf9a3b3-e8e2-4d4f-aff2-b0f555f26884-1
00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:41.071
oil rig layer as this is what
we're going to be running the

daf9a3b3-e8e2-4d4f-aff2-b0f555f26884-2
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:42.040
buffer tool on.

d3dda8f8-9b2e-43f6-bfbb-9974a837c978-0
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.000
So now let's get up the buffer
tool window.

32bff60e-44ac-4095-9fac-e1d1cacefd4a-0
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:56.880
We'll go into the processing
toolbox and type in buffer and

32bff60e-44ac-4095-9fac-e1d1cacefd4a-1
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.280
it's under the vector geometry
toolbox.

298eaf12-96d9-47d7-b4ae-362cf47de6c6-0
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.680
It's just called buffer.

436accda-6cae-4573-9e57-8f167be48043-0
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.080
So it's this one here.

215e7199-3c58-4a20-86e6-7df4fe19642c-0
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.200
The first thing we need to
choose is our input layer.

d3c1c6d8-9597-4a57-9351-0a77206b4c0a-0
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.513
So what we want to create a
buffer around and that's going

d3c1c6d8-9597-4a57-9351-0a77206b4c0a-1
00:01:15.513 --> 00:01:20.119
to be the oil rig and then the
distance, we want a buffer of 1

d3c1c6d8-9597-4a57-9351-0a77206b4c0a-2
00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.240
kilometre around the oil rig.

3687a3f1-03f2-4789-95b8-9cb5ac0c0a40-0
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.674
So we're going to choose the
kilometre option and type one in

3687a3f1-03f2-4789-95b8-9cb5ac0c0a40-1
00:01:27.674 --> 00:01:33.108
this box here and then we have
some other options that we can

3687a3f1-03f2-4789-95b8-9cb5ac0c0a40-2
00:01:33.108 --> 00:01:34.159
choose here.

41c32850-4b45-4e93-9062-683fb4b33df5-0
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.040
So these are how the buffer is
going to end up looking.

40185070-ea49-4872-b699-956f57f4bbaf-0
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.202
The segments is how many lines
the tool is going to use to show

40185070-ea49-4872-b699-956f57f4bbaf-1
00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:48.044
where to draw the buffer around
the feature five is the default

40185070-ea49-4872-b699-956f57f4bbaf-2
00:01:48.044 --> 00:01:50.919
and that's fine for what we're
doing.

51734243-92a4-46da-9885-e2ea1d2a6436-0
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.749
But if you're using the buffer
tool in the future you might

51734243-92a4-46da-9885-e2ea1d2a6436-1
00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:58.040
want to play around with this
and see what works best.

ed55f4c4-daf4-4b14-91fe-56627d17a346-0
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.392
The end cap style we only need
to worry about when we have line

ed55f4c4-daf4-4b14-91fe-56627d17a346-1
00:02:03.392 --> 00:02:07.698
features, so we're working with
a Polygon, we don't need to

ed55f4c4-daf4-4b14-91fe-56627d17a346-2
00:02:07.698 --> 00:02:08.560
change this.

75f659d7-8e32-4deb-b218-d33d3307521c-0
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.560
And then the join style.

28fd0773-c5fd-48d6-9f15-428864b7a415-0
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.250
This is how the buffer is
actually going to look, the

28fd0773-c5fd-48d6-9f15-428864b7a415-1
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.000
shape of it.

8d393989-0b3e-4fe3-94ab-e326b2a40ee7-0
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.075
So we've got a round option,
we've got the mitre option which

8d393989-0b3e-4fe3-94ab-e326b2a40ee7-1
00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:24.561
is a square, and we've got the
bevel option which is like a

8d393989-0b3e-4fe3-94ab-e326b2a40ee7-2
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:25.159
diamond.

d5505588-443c-4e6f-95f9-d0be2c5bf707-0
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.813
The mitre limit we don't need to
worry about as it's only if we

d5505588-443c-4e6f-95f9-d0be2c5bf707-1
00:02:31.813 --> 00:02:34.080
set that as the join style.

5b8c525c-68f6-4340-88c9-586b8be36b95-0
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.800
And we also have a toggle box to
dissolve the result.

817cbfe0-289b-4051-8cd7-078952ad7613-0
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.239
We don't need to worry about
this because we only have one

817cbfe0-289b-4051-8cd7-078952ad7613-1
00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:42.760
Polygon.

31d06203-2cb3-408b-bb28-99bd5c397365-0
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.403
But if we had lots of features,
say lots of points, and when we

31d06203-2cb3-408b-bb28-99bd5c397365-1
00:02:47.403 --> 00:02:51.017
created the buffers they
overlapped, then this would

31d06203-2cb3-408b-bb28-99bd5c397365-2
00:02:51.017 --> 00:02:55.040
dissolve the boundaries between
those overlapping buffers.

3b5ec482-49b9-47e0-86ee-d3a83af58422-0
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.360
But we don't need to worry about
this.

b6939966-f047-46d4-b7f7-d5258d3e9965-0
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.388
So all we need to do now is just
choose where to save the new

b6939966-f047-46d4-b7f7-d5258d3e9965-1
00:03:01.388 --> 00:03:03.160
layer to and what to name it.

88cd6565-f9e2-4775-96d2-afa2bca4b4f8-0
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.732
So we're going to click on these
three dots here and choose Save

88cd6565-f9e2-4775-96d2-afa2bca4b4f8-1
00:03:07.732 --> 00:03:08.640
to Geo Package.

4da19e30-55e8-45d7-b218-c1e09c6868e5-0
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.595
Make sure it's going into that
Geo package we set up and we can

4da19e30-55e8-45d7-b218-c1e09c6868e5-1
00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:21.676
name it oil rig Buffer click,
OK, hit run and there on our

4da19e30-55e8-45d7-b218-c1e09c6868e5-2
00:03:21.676 --> 00:03:26.520
map, we can see the buffer
around the oil rig.

26433e41-122d-4e99-bb13-9cca68d83dbf-0
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.200
So let's zoom into this layer.

087b9711-3c20-42d7-953d-0e38ea494b78-0
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.216
We can see the buffer around the
oil rig and we can also see that

087b9711-3c20-42d7-953d-0e38ea494b78-1
00:03:39.216 --> 00:03:44.573
it's overlapping with our
proposed No Take zone, which is

087b9711-3c20-42d7-953d-0e38ea494b78-2
00:03:44.573 --> 00:03:47.160
this green layer underneath.

afc34274-17bd-4a87-abd7-6fdcb112a42f-0
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.116
So we're going to have to remove
this area of the No take zone,

afc34274-17bd-4a87-abd7-6fdcb112a42f-1
00:03:56.116 --> 00:03:58.520
but we'll do that in the next
video.

6ebc7450-3172-4652-bd7f-ac2cb2443781-0
00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.440
So for now, just remember to hit
save to save your progress.
