00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.400
In this video we're going to be
using the query builder in QGIS.

a88815ac-2305-478d-911a-e7a5c5d2cc70-0
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.221
But first of all, let's organise
our layers list and delete some

a88815ac-2305-478d-911a-e7a5c5d2cc70-1
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:14.120
of the layers that we don't need
any more.

17f6c506-1f6c-4dc2-a61a-b58ad22a754c-0
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.577
So the first layer we can delete
are our sighting points that

17f6c506-1f6c-4dc2-a61a-b58ad22a754c-1
00:00:18.577 --> 00:00:21.720
don't have the environment data
attached to them.

cb87c7de-cab9-4093-8e35-9eacde352909-0
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.668
So right click on this data
layer and click remove layer and

cb87c7de-cab9-4093-8e35-9eacde352909-1
00:00:29.668 --> 00:00:30.000
OK.

ddfbbc27-cc7d-41eb-a1a5-71c33769ac01-0
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.294
And just a point to make here,
if we wanted to add this layer

ddfbbc27-cc7d-41eb-a1a5-71c33769ac01-1
00:00:35.294 --> 00:00:39.795
back into our layers list as
we'd saved it previously in the

ddfbbc27-cc7d-41eb-a1a5-71c33769ac01-2
00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:41.640
Geo package that we made.

760cb565-6edf-4777-b0a4-0fa2619875de-0
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.966
We can access this Geo package
in our browser panel by going

760cb565-6edf-4777-b0a4-0fa2619875de-1
00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:53.490
into our Hippogriffs folder and
then we should see our

760cb565-6edf-4777-b0a4-0fa2619875de-2
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.800
Hippogriff Geo package.

fb109a82-8385-4e82-acf7-87d37dc3e46d-0
00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.112
So we can open this up and we
can see our two point data

fb109a82-8385-4e82-acf7-87d37dc3e46d-1
00:01:00.112 --> 00:01:02.080
layers in this Geopackage.

6374d385-863d-4b53-89fc-a40bb83fe683-0
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.546
So if we wanted to add it back
in, we could add it in from

6374d385-863d-4b53-89fc-a40bb83fe683-1
00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:05.840
here.

092a4a01-fd66-4682-ad39-c57f6a733c64-0
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.235
And then the other two things we
can remove are our two tables in

092a4a01-fd66-4682-ad39-c57f6a733c64-1
00:01:12.235 --> 00:01:13.320
our layers list.

62723a3f-90e9-4f13-8cf8-bef255bd041f-0
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.320
So we'll right click on these
and remove them as well.

d1ee11fa-3dcc-42ba-ab0a-5f32b392f06e-0
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.042
And now let's run the query
builder to select the data that

d1ee11fa-3dcc-42ba-ab0a-5f32b392f06e-1
00:01:30.042 --> 00:01:30.650
we want.

a8ee1a4a-0bf2-431e-9ea9-776322176ead-0
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.287
So we're going to right click on
our Hippogriff Sightings and go

a8ee1a4a-0bf2-431e-9ea9-776322176ead-1
00:01:36.287 --> 00:01:37.560
into properties.

640159ef-0a4f-4df4-a2e6-f9d8fc8fdf9a-0
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.763
And then we want to go into the
Source tab and look just under

640159ef-0a4f-4df4-a2e6-f9d8fc8fdf9a-1
00:01:44.763 --> 00:01:49.600
the section that says Provider
Feature Filter.

3439aa54-1f65-40db-9786-146e603288f7-0
00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.712
There's a button called Query
Builder and we're going to click

3439aa54-1f65-40db-9786-146e603288f7-1
00:01:55.712 --> 00:02:00.941
on this and now in this window
we can select what criteria we

3439aa54-1f65-40db-9786-146e603288f7-2
00:02:00.941 --> 00:02:03.639
want our data to be filtered by.

4fb18fe9-330f-48ac-a5a3-8d30c5a10123-0
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.141
We're trying to find the
sighting of a nest that occurred

4fb18fe9-330f-48ac-a5a3-8d30c5a10123-1
00:02:08.141 --> 00:02:09.560
in a secondary forest.

b61132f5-8dfe-494b-b16c-f39c2aad380f-0
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.986
So the first clause that we're
going to set is where sighting

b61132f5-8dfe-494b-b16c-f39c2aad380f-1
00:02:13.986 --> 00:02:15.080
is equal to nest.

e2cbc0a4-bdae-481d-a7b7-31f7b2dd868f-0
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.920
So let's click the sighting
field in the fields lists.

18ed321c-a18c-4124-9266-d3ad0bc4573e-0
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.567
Double click on this and then we
can click on the equals sign and

18ed321c-a18c-4124-9266-d3ad0bc4573e-1
00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:32.415
then to see the values within
this field we need to click on

18ed321c-a18c-4124-9266-d3ad0bc4573e-2
00:02:32.415 --> 00:02:37.880
the all button here and now we
can double click on nest.

c7af69a9-21d5-4c85-8a48-5c00943e0a44-0
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.840
So that's our first clause set.

91cb39bf-a6da-491c-abe8-4a6095b29e47-0
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.480
But the sighting was a nest and
it was in a secondary forest.

048c05c5-455f-4b16-9836-585116825222-0
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:54.115
So we need to click the and
button and then our environments

048c05c5-455f-4b16-9836-585116825222-1
00:02:54.115 --> 00:02:57.080
are in the field environment.

f70315a3-e7a2-4f1b-a946-761bbd7639b9-0
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:07.126
So we can double click on this
and then equals to click on all

f70315a3-e7a2-4f1b-a946-761bbd7639b9-1
00:03:07.126 --> 00:03:15.897
to get our values and double
click on secondary forest and

f70315a3-e7a2-4f1b-a946-761bbd7639b9-2
00:03:15.897 --> 00:03:24.520
now we can hit OK we'll click
apply and OK again I agree.

8d65bd96-404d-49f8-8551-f123fd1bb5de-0
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.803
We can see that our points on
our map have been filtered for

8d65bd96-404d-49f8-8551-f123fd1bb5de-1
00:03:28.803 --> 00:03:33.437
our criteria and we can only see
the points that fit the criteria

8d65bd96-404d-49f8-8551-f123fd1bb5de-2
00:03:33.437 --> 00:03:34.280
that we set.

a4f727b0-7cd5-4c6b-b11b-9c95e310e69f-0
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.830
So we know that the sighting
occurred in Wonegizi protected

a4f727b0-7cd5-4c6b-b11b-9c95e310e69f-1
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.160
area.

0aa95856-f672-41c9-9119-1c0de1d7e70d-0
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.477
This is the red Polygon for me
on my map and we can see that we

0aa95856-f672-41c9-9119-1c0de1d7e70d-1
00:03:44.477 --> 00:03:49.203
only have one data point here
where there was a nest sighting

0aa95856-f672-41c9-9119-1c0de1d7e70d-2
00:03:49.203 --> 00:03:50.880
in a secondary forest.

154eb404-1adb-4044-885f-e2cd3b84bad1-0
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.758
So this must be where we have
our missing data point because

154eb404-1adb-4044-885f-e2cd3b84bad1-1
00:03:55.758 --> 00:03:58.760
two nests were actually at this
location.

50d6173d-8f27-4579-b41a-15d3588376c1-0
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.075
So in the next video we'll be
adding another point to this

50d6173d-8f27-4579-b41a-15d3588376c1-1
00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:06.360
location, so just hit save to
save our progress.
