00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:08.215
In this video we're going to be
running the difference tool as

07918441-ef92-457b-8cd6-670825d46409-1
00:00:08.215 --> 00:00:10.880
when we created the buffer

19232b12-90d8-4dbb-9d93-4e1001106ce1-0
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.055
we can see that the buffer zone
of the oil rig overlaps with our

19232b12-90d8-4dbb-9d93-4e1001106ce1-1
00:00:18.055 --> 00:00:20.240
proposed No take zone.

574c6f5b-1e9b-421a-808e-f9c8f17401a2-0
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.646
As the oil rig is already
established, we need to create

574c6f5b-1e9b-421a-808e-f9c8f17401a2-1
00:00:24.646 --> 00:00:28.546
our No Take zone around the
buffer of the oil rig, the one

574c6f5b-1e9b-421a-808e-f9c8f17401a2-2
00:00:28.546 --> 00:00:29.999
kilometre buffer zone.

3285ca29-3334-4635-993e-1c309d5644a0-0
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.896
And so we want to remove this
section of our No Take layer so

3285ca29-3334-4635-993e-1c309d5644a0-1
00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:40.440
that it doesn't have any
overlaps with this buffer.

428ae4a0-52c2-4735-9280-aa885b0adc69-0
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.040
So let's go in the toolbox and
open up the difference tool.

d8dc7e9f-2d93-4e43-8a0b-80bab2cad968-0
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.960
It's under vector overlay and we
need to put in our input layer.

af8a1abc-5c49-4a0c-9f88-0f2513fd3580-0
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.680
So this is the layer that we're
removing or cutting away from.

2be54dd7-975c-46ae-a9b2-366f113b3e4c-0
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.560
And so that's our new no take
layer.

22ef2ec6-4549-4ea4-9025-b60d9d687f76-0
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.515
And then the overlay layer is
what layer is going to tell QGIS

22ef2ec6-4549-4ea4-9025-b60d9d687f76-1
00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:08.480
where to cut this layer.

94e34e85-6cb4-4063-8f24-32a01f072527-0
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.080
And so that's going to be the
oil rig buffer.

5291e03f-f52b-4af1-8683-a54c40571d56-0
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.872
And then the last thing we need
to do is just choose where to

5291e03f-f52b-4af1-8683-a54c40571d56-1
00:01:16.872 --> 00:01:19.680
save the new layer that it's
going to create to.

59907cc9-1068-4775-bebe-30831a57c2f7-0
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.751
So we're going to save it to Geo
package like normal, choose our

59907cc9-1068-4775-bebe-30831a57c2f7-1
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:28.560
Geo package and then we'll
choose our layer name.

c3929105-c5ff-42e9-b763-278b2549ceb2-0
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.635
And so we're going to call it No
Take final,  and click OK and

c3929105-c5ff-42e9-b763-278b2549ceb2-1
00:01:36.635 --> 00:01:39.560
then we'll run the tool.

4c1c950a-6ba5-47ea-acb4-ef0d345b6bec-0
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.953
And now if we toggle off the oil
rig buffer layer and the

4c1c950a-6ba5-47ea-acb4-ef0d345b6bec-1
00:01:48.953 --> 00:01:54.803
original no take layer, we can
see that our new new layer has

4c1c950a-6ba5-47ea-acb4-ef0d345b6bec-2
00:01:54.803 --> 00:02:00.560
that chunk taken out of it where
the buffer was overlapping.

c82406c2-1c32-4d60-a9f9-f1c318804a1d-0
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.892
So you can right click on this
new layer and click Zoom to

c82406c2-1c32-4d60-a9f9-f1c318804a1d-1
00:02:06.892 --> 00:02:11.991
layer and we can see it's
exactly the same as the layer

c82406c2-1c32-4d60-a9f9-f1c318804a1d-2
00:02:11.991 --> 00:02:17.728
before except it's taken the cut
out here the section out here

c82406c2-1c32-4d60-a9f9-f1c318804a1d-3
00:02:17.728 --> 00:02:23.374
where the buffer was overlapping
and so that's how to run the

c82406c2-1c32-4d60-a9f9-f1c318804a1d-4
00:02:23.374 --> 00:02:25.560
difference tool in QGIS.

bedeaba7-d35b-48cb-b594-717dbb576770-0
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.680
So as always, just hit save to
save your progress.
