2fa5858a-ca22-4edd-b827-3493807b0717-0
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.721
So we can see our table of data,
but we can't actually see where

2fa5858a-ca22-4edd-b827-3493807b0717-1
00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:08.240
these data points are on a map.

ec68a696-a3a0-443a-acb8-cc49bb69083d-0
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.720
To do that we need to use the
tool XY Table to point.

47260cb5-f190-49a0-83c7-be90732303e7-0
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:25.666
To access this tool we need to
go into the Analysis tab at the

47260cb5-f190-49a0-83c7-be90732303e7-1
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:29.400
top and click on Tools.

72f80189-5f45-4b63-a48b-55f03e6678a3-0
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.880
Now on the right hand side we
have the Geoprocessing pane.

3980ae2f-8533-441e-a259-b14bd103f26c-0
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.120
So in the search bar we can put
in XY table to point and it's

3980ae2f-8533-441e-a259-b14bd103f26c-1
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.000
come up here at the top.

dc4325c2-12ef-4333-861f-9b037ff63eea-0
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.781
So once you have it, click on
this and it's going to bring up

dc4325c2-12ef-4333-861f-9b037ff63eea-1
00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:54.760
the window to run this tool.

e790763c-56c0-4540-9cc3-29a3013bf2da-0
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.755
And to run this tool we need to
put in the parameters to be able

e790763c-56c0-4540-9cc3-29a3013bf2da-1
00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:01.520
to do that.

0fb0742f-b5d5-49ce-b708-6928cca5f616-0
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.423
So the first one is what is the
input table and that's going to

0fb0742f-b5d5-49ce-b708-6928cca5f616-1
00:01:07.423 --> 00:01:10.280
be our hippogriff sightings
table.

25f6076f-521f-4e04-86f2-d0d8c30aa488-0
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.566
So an easy way to put this in is
just to click hold and drag it

25f6076f-521f-4e04-86f2-d0d8c30aa488-1
00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:21.613
from the contents into the top
section here under where it says

25f6076f-521f-4e04-86f2-d0d8c30aa488-2
00:01:21.613 --> 00:01:22.559
Input Table.

f3a9c3a7-0f28-457d-91fc-e34eaaeaa8f6-0
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.080
Going down we have the output
feature class and in this box we

f3a9c3a7-0f28-457d-91fc-e34eaaeaa8f6-1
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.631
can choose where we want to save
the output and what we want to

f3a9c3a7-0f28-457d-91fc-e34eaaeaa8f6-2
00:01:34.631 --> 00:01:35.200
name it.

89c8244d-bb1f-4da2-98dd-67bbd0e28779-0
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.996
So we can click on the browse
icon here and then in the

89c8244d-bb1f-4da2-98dd-67bbd0e28779-1
00:01:40.996 --> 00:01:44.800
browser we can choose where we
want to save it.

fb3c3118-5c9e-48bf-82f4-85490249a23c-0
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.468
So I'm in the Hippogriff project
folder here and inside we have a

fb3c3118-5c9e-48bf-82f4-85490249a23c-1
00:01:50.468 --> 00:01:55.264
geodatabase that ArcGIS Pro has
automatically created for us

fb3c3118-5c9e-48bf-82f4-85490249a23c-2
00:01:55.264 --> 00:02:00.296
when we set up this project, and
this is a great place to store

fb3c3118-5c9e-48bf-82f4-85490249a23c-3
00:02:00.296 --> 00:02:03.520
all of our related data to this
project.

7b72f5f5-77ba-47da-a61f-a6dac0b85807-0
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.076
So let's go into the geodatabase
by clicking on it twice and then

7b72f5f5-77ba-47da-a61f-a6dac0b85807-1
00:02:09.076 --> 00:02:13.000
we can name the output that
we're going to create.

5b06d9d8-1d41-4713-b370-a3c1266f1f7f-0
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.040
So let's name it Hippogriff
Sightings and hit Save.

6928244d-ccca-43fc-b9fc-c73d88a3baa8-0
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.325
The next thing we need to look
at is the X field and the Y

6928244d-ccca-43fc-b9fc-c73d88a3baa8-1
00:02:24.325 --> 00:02:24.680
field.

4b2087eb-05db-49f2-8a53-b72871d741a2-0
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.844
So in these boxes, you're going
to choose what columns within

4b2087eb-05db-49f2-8a53-b72871d741a2-1
00:02:29.844 --> 00:02:34.840
your table represent the X field
and what represent the Y field.

4244c4ef-aef4-457d-a8f0-740ff62f5177-0
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.375
So the X is always going to be
longitude and the Y is always

4244c4ef-aef4-457d-a8f0-740ff62f5177-1
00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:44.680
going to be latitude.

709fa52e-d87b-4a26-b018-e8f8839dc486-0
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.042
A good way to remember this is
that you go along the corridor

709fa52e-d87b-4a26-b018-e8f8839dc486-1
00:02:52.042 --> 00:02:54.240
and then up the stairs.

61148dca-009a-4358-bc9c-29a6174ec6f4-0
00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.501
So your X is longitude, your Y
is latitude, and these are the

61148dca-009a-4358-bc9c-29a6174ec6f4-1
00:03:00.501 --> 00:03:06.057
fields that are going to allow
us to actually plot the data

61148dca-009a-4358-bc9c-29a6174ec6f4-2
00:03:06.057 --> 00:03:08.280
onto our map going down.

27977ad2-7c11-447b-9a00-52f70333ebe8-0
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:17.096
We don't need a Z field because
we don't have any height data in

27977ad2-7c11-447b-9a00-52f70333ebe8-1
00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:18.360
our table.

66e685f0-30f7-4d97-a3ab-d869a307dd70-0
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.358
And then for coordinate system
our data was collected in the

66e685f0-30f7-4d97-a3ab-d869a307dd70-1
00:03:23.358 --> 00:03:25.040
coordinate system WGS 1984.

25b904d9-559d-40c3-9d98-df20726dcea8-0
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.016
ArcGIS has automatically put
that in for us, so that's great,

25b904d9-559d-40c3-9d98-df20726dcea8-1
00:03:30.016 --> 00:03:31.640
it's got the right one.

41623723-51f8-4515-af64-2a378c97088e-0
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.988
If yours isn't saying WGS 1984,
the way to choose the correct

41623723-51f8-4515-af64-2a378c97088e-1
00:03:36.988 --> 00:03:41.897
coordinate system is by clicking
on the icon to the right and

41623723-51f8-4515-af64-2a378c97088e-2
00:03:41.897 --> 00:03:46.805
then in the search bar you can
type in what coordinate system

41623723-51f8-4515-af64-2a378c97088e-3
00:03:46.805 --> 00:03:51.159
your data was collected in so we
can type in WGS 1984.

dcdb7bc2-921a-4cfc-bc0f-b94382cfac43-0
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.668
This is going to narrow down the
searches and then make sure

dcdb7bc2-921a-4cfc-bc0f-b94382cfac43-1
00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:59.827
you're looking in geographic
coordinate system, under world

dcdb7bc2-921a-4cfc-bc0f-b94382cfac43-2
00:03:59.827 --> 00:04:02.600
and the top one we can see is
WGS 1984.

95894e66-439c-4b31-8477-ab4d32a155d3-0
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.440
So we can click on that, click
OK and now we can run our tool.

29cac892-7bad-4bcc-a10f-01c8718b5702-0
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:16.384
So hit run and once that loads,
you should be able to see your

29cac892-7bad-4bcc-a10f-01c8718b5702-1
00:04:16.384 --> 00:04:21.120
points of the sightings on your
map.

5f39dd25-cd64-4fd9-884d-e18cd5d3be7d-0
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.899
We've created a vector data
layer, we can see it in our

5f39dd25-cd64-4fd9-884d-e18cd5d3be7d-1
00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:29.560
contents, the hippogriff
sightings from our table.

e5de025d-81b9-47b0-b417-39e9b01bb0d3-0
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.560
So all we need to do now is just
hit save.
