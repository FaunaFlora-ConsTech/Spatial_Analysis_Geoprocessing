00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.513
In this video, we're going to be
running the erase tool as when

e2b1cf60-4873-4bc7-b080-82e506039c58-1
00:00:05.513 --> 00:00:09.600
we created the buffer zone
around the oil rig, we saw that

e2b1cf60-4873-4bc7-b080-82e506039c58-2
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.480
it overlaps with the No Take
zone that we're proposing.

b2bb0333-7e4d-481b-87d5-dad56ab79d0d-0
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.867
And as this oil rig is already
established, we need to create

b2bb0333-7e4d-481b-87d5-dad56ab79d0d-1
00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:20.200
our No Take zone around this
buffer.

620334d0-d718-4eb8-bd59-efac215ecd37-0
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.937
So what we want to do is we want
to remove this intersection from

620334d0-d718-4eb8-bd59-efac215ecd37-1
00:00:25.937 --> 00:00:28.040
our proposed No Take zone.

e8ca8dc5-e225-46a9-9abb-65cc9ba72a3d-0
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.960
So let's find the erase tool.

a04720eb-33ee-41e4-90fd-84ef389d9cac-0
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.494
We're going to the Geoprocessing
pane and type in erase, and it's

a04720eb-33ee-41e4-90fd-84ef389d9cac-1
00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:41.040
the top tool, and this is a
really simple tool to run.

6371ee63-5edb-404c-a099-0b6c80e3c485-0
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.565
The first thing parameter we
need to put in is the input

6371ee63-5edb-404c-a099-0b6c80e3c485-1
00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:47.240
feature.

0f49276c-d130-4fab-b71f-6e90674a35be-0
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.320
And so this is going to be the
layer that we're applying the

0f49276c-d130-4fab-b71f-6e90674a35be-1
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.440
erase tool to.

de22231d-1a6b-4180-80c8-e5310d8b5c19-0
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.787
So that's going to be our
spawning grounds layer as we

de22231d-1a6b-4180-80c8-e5310d8b5c19-1
00:00:56.787 --> 00:00:59.640
need to cut the intersection out
of this layer.

1ea187ef-a826-49c4-9a29-bedb705254e7-0
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.920
And the erase feature is what
layer we're using to tell Arc

1ea187ef-a826-49c4-9a29-bedb705254e7-1
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.640
GIS where to cut our input
layer.

4369d370-e1a8-44a7-8131-40893a307f35-0
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.562
So this is going to be the oil
rig buffer and then we just need

4369d370-e1a8-44a7-8131-40893a307f35-1
00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:18.680
to choose where to save the new
layer to and what to name it.

cfe5721f-4624-4870-a524-668e863dc309-0
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.305
So we'll make sure that we're in
our Geodatabase and we can name

cfe5721f-4624-4870-a524-668e863dc309-1
00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:34.040
it something like spawning
months erased, click save.

b4921173-8673-48fe-8afe-8683af9a7d48-0
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:44.098
And now we can run the tool and
now we can see this new layer in

b4921173-8673-48fe-8afe-8683af9a7d48-1
00:01:44.098 --> 00:01:45.990
our contents.

b598fdff-9aa3-4c40-a133-b1400b68cacd-0
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.038
So we'll just toggle off the oil
rig buffer layer and the

b598fdff-9aa3-4c40-a133-b1400b68cacd-1
00:01:50.038 --> 00:01:52.830
original spawning months no take
layer.

43e6f04c-e880-4aa8-b87b-55b0bc887e45-0
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.749
And now we can see that this new
layer has got the intersection

43e6f04c-e880-4aa8-b87b-55b0bc887e45-1
00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:02.080
with the oil rig buffer removed
from it.

a446ea32-682b-4124-9b83-cb6cb54784c9-0
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.745
So you can see how ArcGIS Pro
has used the oil rig buffer

a446ea32-682b-4124-9b83-cb6cb54784c9-1
00:02:08.745 --> 00:02:13.600
layer to cut a section from this
this new layer.

369b6dd8-3bc7-4d6a-80a3-8ca146d3daac-0
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.168
And if we zoom out, we can see
where it's taken that

369b6dd8-3bc7-4d6a-80a3-8ca146d3daac-1
00:02:18.168 --> 00:02:19.480
intersection out.

8ef017d0-dad9-4f41-8f07-aea653527d80-0
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.920
And so that's how to run an
erase tool in ArcGIS Pro.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.120
Just remember to hit save.
