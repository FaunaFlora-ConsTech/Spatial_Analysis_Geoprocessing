00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.717
To export selected features in
QGIS, the first thing you need

767248f1-07fb-4ce2-bb7f-95954d5bd93e-1
00:00:07.717 --> 00:00:11.360
to do is run the required
selection on your data.

e77740e1-b58b-4768-bddb-76628eff9e55-0
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.777
In this video we will go over
how to export features selected

e77740e1-b58b-4768-bddb-76628eff9e55-1
00:00:16.777 --> 00:00:18.720
by the location of Ziama.

e5bf07d4-87ee-47e4-8f5e-7e6f2ba36f35-0
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.491
So we're going to run a
selection like we did previously

e5bf07d4-87ee-47e4-8f5e-7e6f2ba36f35-1
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:24.400
in this course.

dd2288ec-3393-46db-905d-21f628a59426-0
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.149
So we can either access the
Select by Location button in the

dd2288ec-3393-46db-905d-21f628a59426-1
00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:37.327
selection toolbar up here, or we
can search for the for it within

dd2288ec-3393-46db-905d-21f628a59426-2
00:00:37.327 --> 00:00:39.480
the Processing toolbox.

bc1820ec-0c0e-4d4e-8656-a504166b6ec9-0
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.720
So we'd bring up the toolbox
here and search.

0895d07e-1d20-4383-869b-11918dffc4c2-0
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.674
So bring up the Select by
Location tool and we want to

0895d07e-1d20-4383-869b-11918dffc4c2-1
00:00:50.674 --> 00:00:56.189
select features from the
projected points to make sure

0895d07e-1d20-4383-869b-11918dffc4c2-2
00:00:56.189 --> 00:01:02.707
that that is in the top box and
we want to choose where features

0895d07e-1d20-4383-869b-11918dffc4c2-3
00:01:02.707 --> 00:01:08.623
are within like last time and
it's going to be with inside

0895d07e-1d20-4383-869b-11918dffc4c2-4
00:01:08.623 --> 00:01:14.840
Ziama protected area for this
selection when we ran this tool

9e4fb59b-96cd-4bf5-b8dd-d9513fa0e05c-0
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.846
last time we had to use this
spanner button here because our

9e4fb59b-96cd-4bf5-b8dd-d9513fa0e05c-1
00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:26.458
data was not in the same
projection and so we had to set

9e4fb59b-96cd-4bf5-b8dd-d9513fa0e05c-2
00:01:26.458 --> 00:01:28.920
an option to bypass this.

8394003e-bb81-45c1-b66b-4ce93e952fee-0
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.526
If you haven't projected your
layers yet then what you'll need

8394003e-bb81-45c1-b66b-4ce93e952fee-1
00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:37.715
to do is click on the spanner
icon here and then in the drop

8394003e-bb81-45c1-b66b-4ce93e952fee-2
00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:40.599
down box choose the Do not
filter option.

b9d3cc52-1863-42eb-9d03-466d6cf8105d-0
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.828
And now we want to make sure
that it says we're creating a

b9d3cc52-1863-42eb-9d03-466d6cf8105d-1
00:01:47.828 --> 00:01:53.360
new selection and then we can
hit run and run the tool.

a0e6e63e-4037-4153-a731-fe1f139da208-0
00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.257
And if we exit this window we
can see that this has selected

a0e6e63e-4037-4153-a731-fe1f139da208-1
00:02:00.257 --> 00:02:04.160
the sighting points within Ziama
protected area.

3fdfa406-aefd-4e2a-9f85-b6b9602c9970-0
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.720
So now we want to export these
selected points.

067bd3ce-d756-4522-b6a8-dff1ba6ff9da-0
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.500
So to do that, we will right
click on our projected points

067bd3ce-d756-4522-b6a8-dff1ba6ff9da-1
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.248
layer, hover over export and
click the Save selected features

067bd3ce-d756-4522-b6a8-dff1ba6ff9da-2
00:02:23.248 --> 00:02:29.560
as option and now we can choose
where we want to save it.

46b7704e-4e95-4396-a3e2-ca60a093e2f8-0
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.763
So the format needs to be
Geopackage to save it into our

46b7704e-4e95-4396-a3e2-ca60a093e2f8-1
00:02:33.763 --> 00:02:38.262
project Geopackage and we can
click on these three dots here

46b7704e-4e95-4396-a3e2-ca60a093e2f8-2
00:02:38.262 --> 00:02:41.360
to choose the Geopackage to save
it into.

af21999d-0b51-41f5-b6f8-405fe5d73209-0
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.190
So we're in our Hippogriffs
folder and we're going to save

af21999d-0b51-41f5-b6f8-405fe5d73209-1
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.040
it into our Hippogriffs
Geopackage.

3913077a-3042-4ab9-84f4-deee3fa00721-0
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.016
So we can double click on this
and then in layer name we can

3913077a-3042-4ab9-84f4-deee3fa00721-1
00:02:52.016 --> 00:02:56.911
choose the name of the layer
that we're going to create, so

3913077a-3042-4ab9-84f4-deee3fa00721-2
00:02:56.911 --> 00:02:59.440
we can call it Ziama sightings.

fa4e8b9b-5e8f-4595-a539-8978c9344aae-0
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.800
Our coordinate reference system
is set to the one that we need.

9d945cf3-d30e-4c1e-90c4-28b04311858b-0
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.778
So that's fine and we don't need
to worry about the other options

9d945cf3-d30e-4c1e-90c4-28b04311858b-1
00:03:08.778 --> 00:03:09.080
here.

db6cb595-a056-4431-8378-41e045cebd20-0
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:16.542
So we can just click OK and once
that loads we can see it in our

db6cb595-a056-4431-8378-41e045cebd20-1
00:03:16.542 --> 00:03:17.920
layers list.

b3a00c7f-2584-41cf-ad7f-c82adcc946f5-0
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.800
We can turn off the projected
points layer and we can see that

b3a00c7f-2584-41cf-ad7f-c82adcc946f5-1
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.586
this exported layer that we have
created is just the sighting

b3a00c7f-2584-41cf-ad7f-c82adcc946f5-2
00:03:29.586 --> 00:03:31.080
points in Ziama.

bbb38a79-5b93-4af9-9bd0-3fd9661b7881-0
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.640
So that's how to export selected
features in QGIS.

b1f2715e-8f15-48c8-abe0-fe5aa29e71ba-0
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.480
So now do the same for Wonegizi
and Wologizi.
