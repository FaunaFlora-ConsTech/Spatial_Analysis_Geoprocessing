7f7acd7f-c728-4d0d-be2d-21b20289af7a-0
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.653
We have decided to project our
data layers into the projection

7f7acd7f-c728-4d0d-be2d-21b20289af7a-1
00:00:06.653 --> 00:00:13.078
WGS 1984 UTM Zone 29 N, so let's
start by projecting the sighting

7f7acd7f-c728-4d0d-be2d-21b20289af7a-2
00:00:13.078 --> 00:00:13.760
points.

861e97b2-b374-402c-8937-711b0462614d-0
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.303
We're going to be using the
Geoprocessing Toolbox to find a

861e97b2-b374-402c-8937-711b0462614d-1
00:00:18.303 --> 00:00:19.440
tool to do this.

f502fd46-9b69-4cfb-a05f-9cf32b6d29e6-0
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.553
So we can go into the Analysis
tab at the top and click on the

f502fd46-9b69-4cfb-a05f-9cf32b6d29e6-1
00:00:26.553 --> 00:00:30.520
Tools button to open up our
toolbox.

dcbf019b-3671-461d-8541-8cf523d8e62a-0
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.400
And now we can search in
Project.

c387b7e3-2ad7-4546-aa9c-93aa3c166c91-0
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.970
So we can see that we've had
lots of tools come up that all

c387b7e3-2ad7-4546-aa9c-93aa3c166c91-1
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.540
say Project on them.

87f5e3e6-5785-4b12-9435-f6a2cbd1c1a4-0
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.220
So what is the right tool to
use?

491482d1-8196-4d35-a67c-89b2d6db0d66-0
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.300
We've got a tool that's called
Project.

383f8482-22b3-427e-b793-f0c8b88e5535-0
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.009
We've got one that's called
Project Raster for projecting

383f8482-22b3-427e-b793-f0c8b88e5535-1
00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:04.460
raster data layers.

01097a71-04fc-4140-bd94-dab0e946acb9-0
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.754
We've got Batch Project, which
lets you project several layers

01097a71-04fc-4140-bd94-dab0e946acb9-1
00:01:09.754 --> 00:01:11.080
at the same time.

375bae65-5ed1-46e9-8c99-064a4b257cd5-0
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.151
We've got Package Project, which
isn't a projection tool, that's

375bae65-5ed1-46e9-8c99-064a4b257cd5-1
00:01:19.151 --> 00:01:23.760
just for packaging up our Arcgis
Pro project.

9fa9826e-089e-414f-a645-62ad633958c5-0
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.117
And then we have Define
Projection, and this is what you

9fa9826e-089e-414f-a645-62ad633958c5-1
00:01:28.117 --> 00:01:32.200
would use if your data layer was
missing a coordinate reference

9fa9826e-089e-414f-a645-62ad633958c5-2
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
system and you needed to give it
a projection.

ba9687c7-1fd2-4de2-a4dd-9c73928d3daf-0
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.160
But our data layers already have
a coordinate reference system.

20d49406-ee1e-4a46-9eaf-b8830e8feff1-0
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.310
We know what they are, we just
want to change this to a new

20d49406-ee1e-4a46-9eaf-b8830e8feff1-1
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.520
one.

4b95c3ad-77c8-491e-9617-9ee5e0331443-0
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.120
And so we're going to use the
project tool.

02813124-0914-4fb9-8991-ee4d5c617532-0
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.040
So click on the project tool to
open up the tool window.

ab71698d-b981-47a7-910e-fac1400ba241-0
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.162
So what this tool is going to do
is it's going to create a new

ab71698d-b981-47a7-910e-fac1400ba241-1
00:01:59.162 --> 00:02:02.207
layer which is our sighting
points, but in the new

ab71698d-b981-47a7-910e-fac1400ba241-2
00:02:02.207 --> 00:02:03.880
coordinate reference system.

5b809f9c-632b-4030-8f38-5c9d7266d567-0
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.320
So let's put in our parameters
for this tool.

5754d548-7e7c-4982-a4d0-c388317cd682-0
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.080
The first thing we have is our
input data set.

b19c1582-e9af-4367-8ee4-a064949db0e0-0
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.400
This is going to be our sighting
points.

394274e0-21bf-4047-8092-a74c843f2b63-0
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.960
So drag these across and put
them in there.

d9a9719e-4dad-47fd-b2cc-47538a795bb8-0
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.969
And we can see that underneath
it's telling us what is the

d9a9719e-4dad-47fd-b2cc-47538a795bb8-1
00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.320
current coordinate reference
system of that data layer.

1fed503c-f2c1-4ef8-af59-a00da9e9e9ff-0
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.469
And then the next thing we need
to do is set a output data set

1fed503c-f2c1-4ef8-af59-a00da9e9e9ff-1
00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:33.200
as this is creating a new data
layer.

676ad743-781d-4a31-af2a-4850b60505f3-0
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.360


60469c8d-76e7-43db-8dc7-a3df4f2ab9ef-0
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.720
So we need to say where we're
going to save it to and what

60469c8d-76e7-43db-8dc7-a3df4f2ab9ef-1
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.640
we're going to name it.

c0e1f5fb-68e2-43eb-8192-5d6ce67c0795-0
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.263
So let's click on the folder
icon to the right of this

c0e1f5fb-68e2-43eb-8192-5d6ce67c0795-1
00:02:45.263 --> 00:02:50.480
section and let's save it in our
Geo database.

b952947e-f4b3-4cbc-b60d-bf513feff489-0
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.070
So navigate to where that Geo
database is, open it up, and now

b952947e-f4b3-4cbc-b60d-bf513feff489-1
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.343
we can name the new data layer
so we can call it projected

b952947e-f4b3-4cbc-b60d-bf513feff489-2
00:03:02.343 --> 00:03:02.880
points

3b3041e9-3fe6-4676-a078-53d33fe2530b-0
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.502
so it's nice and clear that
these are the points with the

3b3041e9-3fe6-4676-a078-53d33fe2530b-1
00:03:08.502 --> 00:03:11.120
new UTM Coordinate Reference
System.

7268a6d8-03a9-4931-a481-c7106067fd75-0
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.575
Our output coordinate system is
the one that we want to change

7268a6d8-03a9-4931-a481-c7106067fd75-1
00:03:15.575 --> 00:03:16.000
it to.

ebef18c2-3325-4b39-8337-a911144ee967-0
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.395
So we can click on the globe
icon to the right of this and we

ebef18c2-3325-4b39-8337-a911144ee967-1
00:03:22.395 --> 00:03:27.462
can search in the UTM projected
coordinate system or search

ebef18c2-3325-4b39-8337-a911144ee967-2
00:03:27.462 --> 00:03:30.840
through the relevant tabs to get
there.

7acd403f-0b98-4b60-ba1e-d159a4bcf22a-0
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.860
But a quick way to do this is we
can click on the drop down box

7acd403f-0b98-4b60-ba1e-d159a4bcf22a-1
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.027
and choose the data layer that
has the coordinate system that

7acd403f-0b98-4b60-ba1e-d159a4bcf22a-2
00:03:40.027 --> 00:03:41.640
we want to change it to.

fd962a72-1cda-4bac-b48e-dfddfdf50156-0
00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.690
So we know Ziama protected area
is already in the UTM coordinate

fd962a72-1cda-4bac-b48e-dfddfdf50156-1
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.200
system.

49047c20-35b8-4002-9627-3114949d1a29-0
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.098
So we can choose this, and now
we can see that it's

49047c20-35b8-4002-9627-3114949d1a29-1
00:03:50.098 --> 00:03:53.331
automatically put in the
coordinate reference system that

49047c20-35b8-4002-9627-3114949d1a29-2
00:03:53.331 --> 00:03:54.000
we're after.

eeff5559-1796-4b43-ab64-58330fd7b86e-0
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.000
So we don't need to worry about
the next section.

aa24073a-de53-4350-8fb3-222b7f1eeab5-0
00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.280
We can just hit run and this is
going to project our data.

0d26a45b-1556-4cc9-812c-118f8921e4ff-0
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.960
And now we can see our projected
points layer in our contents.

38d8c33f-52a2-49f0-8349-b0ed7a4cec2f-0
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.945
So we can delete the other
points layer with the wrong

38d8c33f-52a2-49f0-8349-b0ed7a4cec2f-1
00:04:11.945 --> 00:04:15.420
coordinate reference system just
by right clicking and clicking

38d8c33f-52a2-49f0-8349-b0ed7a4cec2f-2
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.800
remove.

a7d084ff-ce7d-4135-aecd-a2b9b81555fa-0
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.679
And now we're going to project
the two protected areas that are

a7d084ff-ce7d-4135-aecd-a2b9b81555fa-1
00:04:20.679 --> 00:04:23.120
in the wrong coordinate
reference system.

80638383-e37e-4178-956b-738bfbafc287-0
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.720
So that's Wonegizi and Wologizi.

506aa50d-37de-4710-976b-c7642ae563dd-0
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.884
So if we start with Wonegizi, we
can drag this across into the

506aa50d-37de-4710-976b-c7642ae563dd-1
00:04:30.884 --> 00:04:34.320
Input data Set section of our
projection tool.

182741b6-5915-4780-ae35-7f40aa23236c-0
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.030
And again, we can see that it's
showing us what the current

182741b6-5915-4780-ae35-7f40aa23236c-1
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.400
coordinate system of that layer
is.

71086fac-b664-42a0-8d65-795aa38a7ef2-0
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.615
And now let's go and choose
where we want to save the new

71086fac-b664-42a0-8d65-795aa38a7ef2-1
00:04:46.615 --> 00:04:47.240
layer into.

51606d20-176f-4971-b409-23e65e4a6078-0
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.467
So that's going to be our
Geodatabase and we'll call this

51606d20-176f-4971-b409-23e65e4a6078-1
00:04:52.467 --> 00:04:54.920
projected Wonegizi, Click save.

77642ae6-8cf5-4ecc-b405-d6e6998ae0d2-0
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.680
And now we've got our output
coordinate system already there.

ed9f6ee9-def3-4341-936f-377ab4735765-0
00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.640
So we can run it.

39723bae-0754-4c4a-a5ac-081b866c5b87-0
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.611
And once that comes up in our
contents, we can delete the old

39723bae-0754-4c4a-a5ac-081b866c5b87-1
00:05:08.611 --> 00:05:11.640
layer and just leave the
projected Wonegizi.

4d3e7c7c-dcdc-48f9-892b-a91dfe4b15e5-0
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.800
And now we'll do the same for
Wologizi as well.

b4d74c3e-e2b1-45e0-8429-6a4d63e99c36-0
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.640
So we'll drag this across as our
input.

e0af09d9-0216-4bf4-8af0-aa0f6a0ffeac-0
00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.990
We can see the current
coordinate system, let's save it

e0af09d9-0216-4bf4-8af0-aa0f6a0ffeac-1
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.574
into our Geodatabase, name it
projected Wologizi, and the

e0af09d9-0216-4bf4-8af0-aa0f6a0ffeac-2
00:05:34.574 --> 00:05:38.040
coordinate system is there
already.

9a86739e-8b68-42b1-8813-89ed1a631f25-0
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:46.869
So we just need to hit run and
then delete the original

9a86739e-8b68-42b1-8813-89ed1a631f25-1
00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:51.600
Wologizi protected area layer.

dbec115a-97fe-402c-8f93-094543a4ddf5-0
00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.871
So now all of our data layers
are in the same projected

dbec115a-97fe-402c-8f93-094543a4ddf5-1
00:06:01.871 --> 00:06:03.010
coordinate system.

6d9a3b1f-f4e0-401b-864d-424d6231a83e-0
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.690
We need to make sure that our
map is also in the same system.

0b0b5562-2fe0-447d-9bfa-3558171365bf-0
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:14.439
So we can right click on the map
in the contents pane, go into

0b0b5562-2fe0-447d-9bfa-3558171365bf-1
00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:21.440
its properties, and we'll go
into the Coordinate System tab.

dbaf1b6b-f580-413e-a473-23ff4b9bb63a-0
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.393
In the box under where it says
Current XY, we can see it's

dbaf1b6b-f580-413e-a473-23ff4b9bb63a-1
00:06:27.393 --> 00:06:31.738
current coordinate system, so
it's not in the UTM zone 29 N

dbaf1b6b-f580-413e-a473-23ff4b9bb63a-2
00:06:31.738 --> 00:06:32.680
that we want.

1f854680-bf55-4f97-a9a8-bca9c4012fd9-0
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.052
So what we can do is we could
either look through all the

1f854680-bf55-4f97-a9a8-bca9c4012fd9-1
00:06:37.052 --> 00:06:41.011
different coordinate systems
here, looking in the relevant

1f854680-bf55-4f97-a9a8-bca9c4012fd9-2
00:06:41.011 --> 00:06:44.836
tabs, or we can search in our
some of the words from our

1f854680-bf55-4f97-a9a8-bca9c4012fd9-3
00:06:44.836 --> 00:06:47.320
coordinate system to narrow it
down.

ce5c38b7-d472-4b09-9c7b-1a246e6b8932-0
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.108
So we'll type in UTM zone 29 N
and then we know that we need to

ce5c38b7-d472-4b09-9c7b-1a246e6b8932-1
00:06:53.108 --> 00:06:58.337
go in the Projected Coordinate
System tab, we need to go in the

ce5c38b7-d472-4b09-9c7b-1a246e6b8932-2
00:06:58.337 --> 00:07:01.360
UTM tab, and then it's the WGS
1984.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.563
So we go in here and it's 29 N
so we know it's in the northern

6a9cf906-5df6-47ea-96e7-f3f3014a20b0-1
00:07:06.563 --> 00:07:07.360
hemisphere.

8f35b672-c6b5-47e1-9be4-1e34fb766646-0
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.280
And we've got two options here.

5c31aaed-094f-4987-a1e3-2b366d6daaf8-0
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:15.501
It's not the complex 1, so we
need to choose the bottom one

5c31aaed-094f-4987-a1e3-2b366d6daaf8-1
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:21.475
which is just the WGS 1984 UTM
Zone 29 N and click OK and

5c31aaed-094f-4987-a1e3-2b366d6daaf8-2
00:07:21.475 --> 00:07:27.347
that's how to project data
layers and your map in Arcgis

5c31aaed-094f-4987-a1e3-2b366d6daaf8-3
00:07:27.347 --> 00:07:27.760
Pro.

60b2c7e5-863e-4bbd-8dd0-22db6ebbc1f2-0
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.711
This is really important if you
want to create accurate maps or

60b2c7e5-863e-4bbd-8dd0-22db6ebbc1f2-1
00:07:31.711 --> 00:07:34.120
do accurate analysis in
geoprocessing.
