00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.231
In this video we're going to
learn how to select by location

777c2c31-849c-4591-9470-5dcb621fa812-1
00:00:05.231 --> 00:00:09.189
to work out how many sighting
points are in each of the

777c2c31-849c-4591-9470-5dcb621fa812-2
00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:10.320
protected areas.

63285d31-768f-4665-8d89-dd581e601fbf-0
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.633
To begin with, we want to make
sure that we clear any selection

63285d31-768f-4665-8d89-dd581e601fbf-1
00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:17.800
or definition query that we have
on our data already.

acb1654b-f7a0-41c0-baa9-3057f6382b41-0
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.950
To clear a definition query you
want to go into the Sighting

acb1654b-f7a0-41c0-baa9-3057f6382b41-1
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.600
points properties.

2a67a034-2932-430d-80e0-539acebe5de7-0
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.800
So right click and go into
properties.

783d1226-e070-4c41-bc2b-6e57184329ff-0
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.840
Then in the definition query tab
and here is the definition query

783d1226-e070-4c41-bc2b-6e57184329ff-1
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.640
that we set.

fa13096f-2ccf-494e-a7b8-278dca3509b5-0
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.323
So if we hover our mouse over
this we can click on the red X

fa13096f-2ccf-494e-a7b8-278dca3509b5-1
00:00:39.323 --> 00:00:41.040
button to get rid of it.

008f15d4-c6d2-4a37-a5ee-781cab7a84a8-0
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.874
So click on this, click yes and
OK and if we just let this load

008f15d4-c6d2-4a37-a5ee-781cab7a84a8-1
00:00:46.874 --> 00:00:51.988
then we can see we've got all of
our sighting points that have

008f15d4-c6d2-4a37-a5ee-781cab7a84a8-2
00:00:51.988 --> 00:00:52.799
come back.

ff7b1d2e-15f9-4c3e-a7a7-7aeded6f7260-0
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.934
If you have any of the data
points selected on your map, you

ff7b1d2e-15f9-4c3e-a7a7-7aeded6f7260-1
00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:03.827
can go into the Map tab, into
the Selection section and click

ff7b1d2e-15f9-4c3e-a7a7-7aeded6f7260-2
00:01:03.827 --> 00:01:08.800
on the Clear button to get rid
of any selection that you have.

168504f1-70c8-49e1-b4b4-4674c90c0bff-0
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.761
And the Select by Location
button that we're going to use

168504f1-70c8-49e1-b4b4-4674c90c0bff-1
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:22.120
in this video is also in this
section of the map tab.

63214b2b-cae3-4166-9dc3-790f2c3cbad8-0
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:30.555
So click on the Select by
Location button and now we can

63214b2b-cae3-4166-9dc3-790f2c3cbad8-1
00:01:30.555 --> 00:01:36.930
add in the parameters to run
this selection.

8b19c7b6-3fdb-42dd-ba8e-64d96c2e8b4e-0
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.170
So our input features are going
to be our sighting points.

32f69c98-19f2-4611-847d-f686f73db19c-0
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.730
So we've already got this here.

c8bb7e37-60ac-4031-8e20-43743231c439-0
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.803
That's great if you don't have
it, just drag it across from

c8bb7e37-60ac-4031-8e20-43743231c439-1
00:01:46.803 --> 00:01:50.810
your contents and then we need
to choose the relationship.

3fcd1dae-7ba1-4b93-a3ef-d42f0e66aedf-0
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.893
So if we click on the drop down
box for this section, we can see

3fcd1dae-7ba1-4b93-a3ef-d42f0e66aedf-1
00:01:56.893 --> 00:02:01.627
that there's lots of different
types of relationship or how we

3fcd1dae-7ba1-4b93-a3ef-d42f0e66aedf-2
00:02:01.627 --> 00:02:03.280
want to run this tool.

84f4aaec-4478-4f87-bf97-24663ac583aa-0
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.337
We can hover our mouse over the
info icon and then this gives us

84f4aaec-4478-4f87-bf97-24663ac583aa-1
00:02:10.337 --> 00:02:15.946
some more information about each
type of relationship and so if

84f4aaec-4478-4f87-bf97-24663ac583aa-2
00:02:15.946 --> 00:02:21.468
you wanted to find which type to
use you can read through this

84f4aaec-4478-4f87-bf97-24663ac583aa-3
00:02:21.468 --> 00:02:22.520
information.

5674486a-71ae-43ef-82e2-d608aad2b62e-0
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.364
So we're going to choose the
relationship within as we want

5674486a-71ae-43ef-82e2-d608aad2b62e-1
00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:32.720
to know what sighting points are
within the protected areas.

f30da2d8-0a36-43d1-9e60-78c1b3815b62-0
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.882
So for our selecting features,
we're first of all going to take

f30da2d8-0a36-43d1-9e60-78c1b3815b62-1
00:02:39.882 --> 00:02:45.233
a look at Ziama protected area
so we can click on this in the

f30da2d8-0a36-43d1-9e60-78c1b3815b62-2
00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:50.928
contents and then drag it across
to the section here and the next

f30da2d8-0a36-43d1-9e60-78c1b3815b62-3
00:02:50.928 --> 00:02:53.000
section search distance.

4c18f3ba-b69e-4b0f-a5b8-1ec3453d0f58-0
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.053
We don't need to worry about for
this selection and selection

4c18f3ba-b69e-4b0f-a5b8-1ec3453d0f58-1
00:02:57.053 --> 00:02:59.800
type, we can leave that as new
selection.

cd3bd371-e83b-489f-b3af-c47d232bc39d-0
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.682
So now we just need to hit apply
and hit OK and now we can see

cd3bd371-e83b-489f-b3af-c47d232bc39d-1
00:03:06.682 --> 00:03:13.145
our selected sighting points for
the sightings that occurred in

cd3bd371-e83b-489f-b3af-c47d232bc39d-2
00:03:13.145 --> 00:03:15.670
the Ziama protected area.

1cd7362c-0231-4b91-94c7-e3e77a334dad-0
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.447
To see how many points or how
many sightings occurred within

1cd7362c-0231-4b91-94c7-e3e77a334dad-1
00:03:21.447 --> 00:03:25.472
Ziama, we need to open up the
attribute table for our sighting

1cd7362c-0231-4b91-94c7-e3e77a334dad-2
00:03:25.472 --> 00:03:25.920
points.

79c63f45-5ef6-408b-89ce-60717e42d900-0
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.632
And then in the bottom of this
table it tells us that 32 points

79c63f45-5ef6-408b-89ce-60717e42d900-1
00:03:40.632 --> 00:03:41.850
have been selected.

5df1bcda-8adf-4e3d-92db-fceefa5a3122-0
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.584
So we know that 32 sightings of
Hippogriffs occurred in Ziama

5df1bcda-8adf-4e3d-92db-fceefa5a3122-1
00:03:46.584 --> 00:03:47.730
protected area.

6fb9e176-c6cf-47d3-8c70-f22e7a550a14-0
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.319
If we wanted to just see the
selected rows, we can click on

6fb9e176-c6cf-47d3-8c70-f22e7a550a14-1
00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.181
this button in the table at the
bottom and now we can just see

6fb9e176-c6cf-47d3-8c70-f22e7a550a14-2
00:03:58.181 --> 00:03:59.570
the selected rows.

507f8748-7b79-45bb-8578-62cc9f14e1bd-0
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.610
And then if you wanted to clear
this select selection, you can

507f8748-7b79-45bb-8578-62cc9f14e1bd-1
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.190
either use the clear that we
used in the map tab before in

507f8748-7b79-45bb-8578-62cc9f14e1bd-2
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.003
the selection section, or if you
have the table open, you can

507f8748-7b79-45bb-8578-62cc9f14e1bd-3
00:04:18.003 --> 00:04:22.972
click on the white corner of the
table and this will just clear

507f8748-7b79-45bb-8578-62cc9f14e1bd-4
00:04:22.972 --> 00:04:24.680
the selection as well.

fa7bf4fe-5cac-489c-ab05-0ff6db0101ff-0
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.755
And so that's how to use the
Select by Location tool in Arc

fa7bf4fe-5cac-489c-ab05-0ff6db0101ff-1
00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:33.400
GIS Pro.

80587409-ecd8-426b-ab2d-fc722ca88207-0
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.547
Now have a go at selecting by
location for Wonegizi and

80587409-ecd8-426b-ab2d-fc722ca88207-1
00:04:39.547 --> 00:04:43.760
Wologizi as well to see how many
sighting points occurred in

80587409-ecd8-426b-ab2d-fc722ca88207-2
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.280
these protected areas.
