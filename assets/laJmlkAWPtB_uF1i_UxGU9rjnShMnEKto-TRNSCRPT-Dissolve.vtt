ffb78801-3f38-4e6f-874f-fbbc973ae4c0-0
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.428
In this video we're going to be
using the Dissolve tool, but

ffb78801-3f38-4e6f-874f-fbbc973ae4c0-1
00:00:05.428 --> 00:00:09.080
first of all, let's just clean
up our layers list again.

e206949d-735c-46fe-93da-b4877bb3e187-0
00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.760


1fc32b3b-523a-4453-9d7e-c2d155e02179-0
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:20.288
We can get rid of the MPA no
Take Zone layer and also the

1fc32b3b-523a-4453-9d7e-c2d155e02179-1
00:00:20.288 --> 00:00:23.680
Spawning Clips layer.

358728e9-9ade-4469-8dbe-8536e2426313-0
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.260
And so in this video we're going
to be using the Dissolve tool.

bb91b3f8-38d0-4836-a467-84b564694691-0
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.766
So the dissolve tool can
dissolve the boundaries between

bb91b3f8-38d0-4836-a467-84b564694691-1
00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:42.879
features within a layer, and it
can also dissolve the boundaries

bb91b3f8-38d0-4836-a467-84b564694691-2
00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.600
based on the attributes of those
features.

07eaa3b3-4569-48bc-8e7e-fbfc2ff444c7-0
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.878
So within our merge data set, we
can see that where the spawning

07eaa3b3-4569-48bc-8e7e-fbfc2ff444c7-1
00:00:50.878 --> 00:00:55.477
grounds and the current no take
MPA zone overlap, we've got some

07eaa3b3-4569-48bc-8e7e-fbfc2ff444c7-2
00:00:55.477 --> 00:00:57.600
boundaries or some lines here.

a46b8daf-a46b-407d-9aa8-ad9e725846ac-0
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.679
We don't want this as we want it
to all be merged together so

a46b8daf-a46b-407d-9aa8-ad9e725846ac-1
00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.971
that we can see where the no
take zone will be during the

a46b8daf-a46b-407d-9aa8-ad9e725846ac-2
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:05.880
spawning months.

42dd2552-b12f-41df-949d-4b85438e3852-0
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.600
So let's open up the dissolve
tool.

047a328d-a5c8-4050-8b21-60805ecae61e-0
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.012
We'll go into the processing
toolbox, type in Dissolve and

047a328d-a5c8-4050-8b21-60805ecae61e-1
00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:21.120
it's this tool here under vector
geometry, the dissolve tool.

c820e5ab-bdcf-467c-86b4-ff3403098854-0
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.325
So we'll open this up and now
our input layer is what layer

c820e5ab-bdcf-467c-86b4-ff3403098854-1
00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:27.800
we're dissolving.

da2ee27f-a95d-43c7-aee5-3bf05e5823b3-0
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.132
And so that's the no take
spawning season layer, our

da2ee27f-a95d-43c7-aee5-3bf05e5823b3-1
00:01:33.132 --> 00:01:34.440
merged layer.

d2807439-8930-408c-b689-a933db6a16a6-0
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.211
So we'll choose this in the drop
down box and then the next thing

d2807439-8930-408c-b689-a933db6a16a6-1
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:41.000
we have is dissolve fields.

2cc71dd7-5d55-40e8-9010-2fba7c7ec505-0
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.205
So using when you use the
dissolve tool, you can also set

2cc71dd7-5d55-40e8-9010-2fba7c7ec505-1
00:01:45.205 --> 00:01:48.970
dissolve fields and these are
the columns within a layers

2cc71dd7-5d55-40e8-9010-2fba7c7ec505-2
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.800
table that tell the tool where
to dissolve the boundaries.

c1861288-1ac0-4ad3-afc9-dd8a572c61fc-0
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.879
It's not relevant for our layer
because we just want to dissolve

c1861288-1ac0-4ad3-afc9-dd8a572c61fc-1
00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:59.824
all the boundaries or any
boundary that's in between the

c1861288-1ac0-4ad3-afc9-dd8a572c61fc-2
00:01:59.824 --> 00:02:01.840
no take zone and the spawning
grounds.

eb6bd732-efac-4f01-a8f2-dbcba7aed596-0
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.876
But if you had a layer for
example, that was a continent

eb6bd732-efac-4f01-a8f2-dbcba7aed596-1
00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:09.557
and you had the boundaries for
the countries, but also the

eb6bd732-efac-4f01-a8f2-dbcba7aed596-2
00:02:09.557 --> 00:02:13.113
boundaries for the regions
within the countries, and you

eb6bd732-efac-4f01-a8f2-dbcba7aed596-3
00:02:13.113 --> 00:02:16.794
didn't want these regional
boundaries anymore, then within

eb6bd732-efac-4f01-a8f2-dbcba7aed596-4
00:02:16.794 --> 00:02:20.413
the dissolve field you could
choose the column within the

eb6bd732-efac-4f01-a8f2-dbcba7aed596-5
00:02:20.413 --> 00:02:23.720
table that tells you what
country each region is in.

cf2bccc2-41e1-4883-80ed-2b2af2b5c2fd-0
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.367
And so this would tell the tool
to dissolve the regional

cf2bccc2-41e1-4883-80ed-2b2af2b5c2fd-1
00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:33.120
boundaries but keep the country
boundaries within the continent.

8991aebf-14d7-4229-bf22-49844f62f2f5-0
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.816
But we can leave this blank as
we can just dissolve any

8991aebf-14d7-4229-bf22-49844f62f2f5-1
00:02:37.816 --> 00:02:40.440
boundary that was that's within
our layer.

ea9da220-369b-4e71-a247-749b0f90360d-0
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.440
And then the next thing or the
last thing we need to do is

ea9da220-369b-4e71-a247-749b0f90360d-1
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.054
choose where we're going to save
the new layer to and what we're

ea9da220-369b-4e71-a247-749b0f90360d-2
00:02:49.054 --> 00:02:50.000
going to name it.

325de50d-8884-4b3c-9e35-c5afaabf5dc5-0
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.223
So we're going to click on the
three dots next to the dissolved

325de50d-8884-4b3c-9e35-c5afaabf5dc5-1
00:02:55.223 --> 00:02:59.892
section here and we're going to
choose Save to Geo package and

325de50d-8884-4b3c-9e35-c5afaabf5dc5-2
00:02:59.892 --> 00:03:04.339
make sure we go into that Geo
package that we've set up and

325de50d-8884-4b3c-9e35-c5afaabf5dc5-3
00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:07.600
now we can choose a name for our
new layer.

3a73932d-3083-4402-aa4a-233d7c90b307-0
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.760
So we'll name it New no Take,
click OK and then run the tool.

bd68bd6d-7759-4ebc-92b1-0a11f3af611c-0
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.120
And now we've got our new layer.

23b42c84-7414-4711-827d-9e348f75e8ad-0
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.180
So if we toggle off the original
layer, we can see that in our

23b42c84-7414-4711-827d-9e348f75e8ad-1
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.846
new layer the boundaries between
the spawning grounds and the

23b42c84-7414-4711-827d-9e348f75e8ad-2
00:03:30.846 --> 00:03:35.587
current MPA no take zone have
been dissolved and so that's how

23b42c84-7414-4711-827d-9e348f75e8ad-3
00:03:35.587 --> 00:03:37.920
to run a dissolve tool in QGIS.

585f2081-a00f-4a30-9219-3954020ef2ef-0
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.160
So just remember to hit save to
save your changes.
