ab3dde28-7a39-48ae-a9d9-5011038b67e9-0
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.103
We've decided to project our
data layers into the projection

ab3dde28-7a39-48ae-a9d9-5011038b67e9-1
00:00:06.103 --> 00:00:10.731
UTM zone 29N. Let's start off
with projecting the sighting

ab3dde28-7a39-48ae-a9d9-5011038b67e9-2
00:00:10.731 --> 00:00:11.280
points.

7e27f3fe-343c-485a-b07c-d699c925b4cc-0
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.345
So we're going to bring up the
processing toolbox to find a

7e27f3fe-343c-485a-b07c-d699c925b4cc-1
00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:20.240
tool to project our data.

63365e54-416d-4c48-9b3d-d52665279f56-0
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.520
So make sure you've got this up.

2cfd0cc7-c727-4149-8a13-6f1de5505bf6-0
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.002
If you don't have it up it's in
the Processing tab and now we

2cfd0cc7-c727-4149-8a13-6f1de5505bf6-1
00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:30.400
can type in project to see what
tools come up.

51811069-08b9-4463-86e0-f49aecd9938d-0
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.032
So we know it's going to be a
vector tool because we're

51811069-08b9-4463-86e0-f49aecd9938d-1
00:00:34.032 --> 00:00:35.360
working with vector layers.

264fe15b-79ab-4b35-ae19-1b841fd47f8d-0
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.301
So let's have a look under the
vector general tools and the

264fe15b-79ab-4b35-ae19-1b841fd47f8d-1
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:47.840
first tool that we can see is
Assign Projection.

acbf4407-c511-4907-8e39-91a09be813a0-0
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.120
So this is what you'd use if
your data layer was missing a

acbf4407-c511-4907-8e39-91a09be813a0-1
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.195
coordinate reference system and
you needed to give it a

acbf4407-c511-4907-8e39-91a09be813a0-2
00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:54.800
projection.

540a37d8-67f8-4fb5-9157-ae9370eca24d-0
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.162
The next one, Define Shape File
Projection does the same thing

540a37d8-67f8-4fb5-9157-ae9370eca24d-1
00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:05.735
as a assign projection but it
generates a new layer with the

540a37d8-67f8-4fb5-9157-ae9370eca24d-2
00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:09.858
new projection whereas the
previous tool doesn't. Find

540a37d8-67f8-4fb5-9157-ae9370eca24d-3
00:01:09.858 --> 00:01:13.906
projection is what you can use
If you don't know what

540a37d8-67f8-4fb5-9157-ae9370eca24d-4
00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:18.704
coordinate reference system your
layer is supposed to be in and

540a37d8-67f8-4fb5-9157-ae9370eca24d-5
00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:22.602
you want to know what
projections it might be, this

540a37d8-67f8-4fb5-9157-ae9370eca24d-6
00:01:22.602 --> 00:01:27.175
tool will help you find some
reference systems that it might

540a37d8-67f8-4fb5-9157-ae9370eca24d-7
00:01:27.175 --> 00:01:27.399
be.

b344d858-554c-473b-834d-cc9b413fef17-0
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.184
So these aren't the tools that
we need because we want to

b344d858-554c-473b-834d-cc9b413fef17-1
00:01:31.184 --> 00:01:34.120
change our layers current
coordinate system.

2f63d21c-c438-46e0-acd2-6e99dd988847-0
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.240
So this is what the reproject
tool is for.

3d84f20c-9113-4e7c-9a16-80cd145f4da3-0
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.311
This is going to let us change
our layers existing coordinate

3d84f20c-9113-4e7c-9a16-80cd145f4da3-1
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:43.520
system to a new coordinate
system.

e8f9a739-2eb3-43a2-9baa-660fdd157b1d-0
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.960
So let's click on this tool to
bring it up.

258928a6-ecb8-4a54-90a3-bbebc52d10ee-0
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.828
Our input layer are our points
and now we need to choose what

258928a6-ecb8-4a54-90a3-bbebc52d10ee-1
00:01:51.828 --> 00:01:56.080
the new coordinate reference
system is going to be.

9df8006d-a688-418b-9579-f322c413b97a-0
00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.680
So we can click on the globe
icon to the right of target CRS.

01590636-582e-4343-b2c7-0bd03f8cda2f-0
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.390
And in this selector tool
there's a long list of all the

01590636-582e-4343-b2c7-0bd03f8cda2f-1
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.360
different coordinate systems.

283a6a78-8919-4a24-9f09-dfc71c062077-0
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.640
But what we can do is we can use
the search bar to filter them.

44bd75e6-fdf1-464a-b0a4-3ce9b9577a49-0
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.874
So we'll type in UTM zone 29 N
and here we can see in the top

44bd75e6-fdf1-464a-b0a4-3ce9b9577a49-1
00:02:19.874 --> 00:02:24.360
box it's come up with the one
that we're after.

66daf119-a46c-4b40-affd-fef9611fbe5f-0
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.271
So we can click on this and
click OK And now this tool is

66daf119-a46c-4b40-affd-fef9611fbe5f-1
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:35.268
going to create a new points
layer with this UTM Zone 29 N

66daf119-a46c-4b40-affd-fef9611fbe5f-2
00:02:35.268 --> 00:02:36.200
projection.

5da16be2-c838-46f0-85a8-15bd7e888ff6-0
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.814
So the last thing we need to do
is choose where to save this new

5da16be2-c838-46f0-85a8-15bd7e888ff6-1
00:02:39.814 --> 00:02:41.320
layer to and what to name it.

dd1bb446-1a72-42ea-8ea6-1ec4ac16148e-0
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.766
So let's go into the three dots
button to the right of where it

dd1bb446-1a72-42ea-8ea6-1ec4ac16148e-1
00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:54.829
says create temporary layer and
we'll choose Save to Geo

dd1bb446-1a72-42ea-8ea6-1ec4ac16148e-2
00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:55.680
package.

35a7e58f-c0ee-4cfe-9ff3-3a555d4a69ae-0
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.141
And then we want to navigate to
find the Geo package that we set

35a7e58f-c0ee-4cfe-9ff3-3a555d4a69ae-1
00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:04.600
up for this project.

a4980929-d02b-4bbf-8275-532133de9ab9-0
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.788
Click on it and now we can name
our layer, so we'll name it

a4980929-d02b-4bbf-8275-532133de9ab9-1
00:03:10.788 --> 00:03:12.440
Projected points.

dca09997-90e0-4fae-920e-6bb2fda1feed-0
00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.178
So it's clear what is the points
layer with the new projection

dca09997-90e0-4fae-920e-6bb2fda1feed-1
00:03:17.178 --> 00:03:19.360
and then we can run the tool.

267e0715-e699-426c-9b37-cbeeaa92e562-0
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.120
So we'll run it and once it's
run we can close this window and

267e0715-e699-426c-9b37-cbeeaa92e562-1
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.520
we can see that it's in our
layers list now.

dd22cd16-e6f2-4678-8bc0-bfbe29dc9ee9-0
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.036
So what we can do is remove the
original sighting points layer

dd22cd16-e6f2-4678-8bc0-bfbe29dc9ee9-1
00:03:33.036 --> 00:03:35.480
because we don't need this
anymore.

fdb3917d-db33-41b9-b778-b36c02010e03-0
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.360
So we'll right click and we will
click remove layer.

0a1abf8c-947d-4d8f-b00d-13ba6dd8afd5-0
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.527
So we projected our sighting
points, so now they're in the

0a1abf8c-947d-4d8f-b00d-13ba6dd8afd5-1
00:03:44.527 --> 00:03:46.280
right projection that we want.

1b4a44cc-5903-4d61-9a17-27bd7c50a865-0
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.142
We're going to do the same with
the Wologizi and Wonegizi

1b4a44cc-5903-4d61-9a17-27bd7c50a865-1
00:03:50.142 --> 00:03:51.120
protected areas.

00d6f10d-7174-4872-8222-f187fbf980ca-0
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.120
So it's going to be exactly the
same process.

c4d88094-6f09-4d16-a993-60b900fa28b2-0
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.920
We're going to bring up the
reproject layer tool.

947fbec5-ebe0-45a8-b7bc-08cc9c1eba71-0
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.240
Our input layer here is
Wologizi.

a1f77634-2832-486a-b5d7-9741b88aa9cb-0
00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:08.938
We're going to click on the
globe icon search in UTM zone 29

a1f77634-2832-486a-b5d7-9741b88aa9cb-1
00:04:08.938 --> 00:04:15.856
N Once we have it come up, we
can click on that And now we can

a1f77634-2832-486a-b5d7-9741b88aa9cb-2
00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:19.920
save our layer into our Geo
package.

4dfbc82b-ee10-43c1-b6c6-05a5b24ceedb-0
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:29.870
So we'll go into our Geo package
and name our layer, so we'll

4dfbc82b-ee10-43c1-b6c6-05a5b24ceedb-1
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:39.674
call it projected Wologizi, hit
OK, run the tool and then delete

4dfbc82b-ee10-43c1-b6c6-05a5b24ceedb-2
00:04:39.674 --> 00:04:42.540
the original layer.

43dbd91e-415f-4938-806c-9a100cbc7567-0
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:51.240
So remove this the Wologizi
protected area and now for

43dbd91e-415f-4938-806c-9a100cbc7567-1
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.560
Wonegizi.

e9ab4d61-6a7f-43dd-a6c4-bdaecc0b30d6-0
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.800
So bring up the reproject layer
tool again.

786b3f21-06ab-4f85-85fa-9b80a6ca6966-0
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.360
Make sure your input layer is
Wonegizi protected area.

2ab89ecc-29a7-40e5-b15b-d9cfee23a1a3-0
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.068
And we can see now in the box in
the recently used coordinate

2ab89ecc-29a7-40e5-b15b-d9cfee23a1a3-1
00:05:04.068 --> 00:05:08.546
reference system box, we can
choose the UTM zone 29 N layer

2ab89ecc-29a7-40e5-b15b-d9cfee23a1a3-2
00:05:08.546 --> 00:05:08.920
here.

872e739d-9008-4597-9dfd-7839d8feaa7f-0
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.038
And now we just need to save it
into our Geo package and name it

872e739d-9008-4597-9dfd-7839d8feaa7f-1
00:05:14.038 --> 00:05:14.600
as well.

dc621882-57f2-4d44-b25c-cd3caebb6020-0
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:22.166
So we'll call it Projected
Wonegizi and hit run and then

dc621882-57f2-4d44-b25c-cd3caebb6020-1
00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:28.400
remove the original Wonegizi
protected area layer.

7f9072fc-65dc-4550-9ecf-a2efe4ec52ef-0
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.897
So now all of our layers are in
the same projected coordinate

7f9072fc-65dc-4550-9ecf-a2efe4ec52ef-1
00:05:35.897 --> 00:05:36.320
system.

77d55f71-8dc0-4a7b-8288-96499fe0075a-0
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.080
We need to make sure that our
map also is.

7498a893-eb10-4614-b8aa-6b0440288f61-0
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.320
So to do this we need to go into
our project properties.

dfeb3472-17e4-4e6c-8f23-11deb1536500-0
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.960
There are two ways to access
this.

c2d0b7bd-96db-416c-b830-1cbf82e63ba3-0
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:54.171
We can either click in the very
bottom right of our screen where

c2d0b7bd-96db-416c-b830-1cbf82e63ba3-1
00:05:54.171 --> 00:06:01.127
it tells us what the current
coordinate system of the map is

c2d0b7bd-96db-416c-b830-1cbf82e63ba3-2
00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:08.425
this button here, or we can go
into the Project tab and go into

c2d0b7bd-96db-416c-b830-1cbf82e63ba3-3
00:06:08.425 --> 00:06:09.680
properties.

164fddfa-1bc2-4984-8cd3-cf9f49e7176e-0
00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.922
So once we have our project
properties come up, we want to

164fddfa-1bc2-4984-8cd3-cf9f49e7176e-1
00:06:17.922 --> 00:06:23.620
go into the tab which is CRS,
and now we can choose the

164fddfa-1bc2-4984-8cd3-cf9f49e7176e-2
00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.960
coordinate system here.

127f00f6-55e4-4c14-aab9-763522186780-0
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.712
And so again, in the recently
used box, we can see the one

127f00f6-55e4-4c14-aab9-763522186780-1
00:06:30.712 --> 00:06:35.378
that we want, the UTM Zone 29 N.
So we'll click on this, hit

127f00f6-55e4-4c14-aab9-763522186780-2
00:06:35.378 --> 00:06:39.280
apply and hit OK And now that's
projected our map.

b4af5d8b-1f39-401c-a9e0-6193b9f12741-0
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.198
So that's how to project your
data layers and your map in

b4af5d8b-1f39-401c-a9e0-6193b9f12741-1
00:06:44.198 --> 00:06:44.560
QGIS.

93cb0681-a845-4932-b8ad-4d9d3bfcd0b0-0
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.280
So let's just hit save to save
our progress.
