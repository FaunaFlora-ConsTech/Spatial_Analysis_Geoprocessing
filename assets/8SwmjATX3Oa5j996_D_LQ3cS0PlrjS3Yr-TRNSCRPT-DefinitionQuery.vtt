00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.940
In this video we're going to run
a definition query, but to start

e8e91535-caa7-4be4-91fd-7447947eb45a-1
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.577
off with let's organise our
contents and delete some of the

e8e91535-caa7-4be4-91fd-7447947eb45a-2
00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:14.359
layers that we don't need any
more.

5e49d3de-a025-4132-a485-6dd178e742d4-0
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So our hippogriff sighting
points that don't have the

5e49d3de-a025-4132-a485-6dd178e742d4-1
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.520
joined environment data we can
remove as we don't need them.

93373322-7e53-4282-94c8-c15dce9962be-0
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.287
So just right click on this
layer without the environment

93373322-7e53-4282-94c8-c15dce9962be-1
00:00:29.287 --> 00:00:35.213
data and click remove. And just
a point to make here as we saved

93373322-7e53-4282-94c8-c15dce9962be-2
00:00:35.213 --> 00:00:38.040
this layer into a Geo database,

7753e4c9-7af5-4708-a387-bb571a88cf95-0
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.427
we can access this layer again
if we wanted to add it back into

7753e4c9-7af5-4708-a387-bb571a88cf95-1
00:00:43.427 --> 00:00:48.366
our project, just by going into
the databases folder in our

7753e4c9-7af5-4708-a387-bb571a88cf95-2
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:53.222
catalog pane, expanding our
Hippogriff project Geodatabase

7753e4c9-7af5-4708-a387-bb571a88cf95-3
00:00:53.222 --> 00:00:57.996
and then we can see our layers
that we've saved into that

7753e4c9-7af5-4708-a387-bb571a88cf95-4
00:00:57.996 --> 00:00:59.560
Geodatabase inside.

ba09cec1-c229-449e-8e13-d39719158b58-0
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.109
So the other things we can
delete are the tables, so just

ba09cec1-c229-449e-8e13-d39719158b58-1
00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:08.200
remove them.

015378ed-afcc-4f5b-bb8c-d02c83031df6-0
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.720
And now let's run our definition
query.

2233caf7-7a73-436f-9ded-c0162bd12c76-0
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.110
So we're going to right click on
our sighting points and go into

2233caf7-7a73-436f-9ded-c0162bd12c76-1
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.260
properties, and then we're going
to go into the Definition Query

2233caf7-7a73-436f-9ded-c0162bd12c76-2
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.126
tab and to add a new query we
can click on the Add New button

2233caf7-7a73-436f-9ded-c0162bd12c76-3
00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:32.599
here.

8a4b5345-bdb7-4cda-a548-395ecd0ea329-0
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.560
And so we're looking for a
sighting of a nest that occurred

8a4b5345-bdb7-4cda-a548-395ecd0ea329-1
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.600
in a secondary forest.

8bfcb12f-337d-4eed-871f-e3bff6317900-0
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.661
So our first clause or our first
query is going to be where

8bfcb12f-337d-4eed-871f-e3bff6317900-1
00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:50.080
sighting is equal to NEST.

327145a9-fedd-4d92-a16b-3667cc462f1a-0
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.922
So in this button here we can
add sighting and then we want it

327145a9-fedd-4d92-a16b-3667cc462f1a-1
00:01:55.922 --> 00:01:57.920
to say is equal to nest.

29b868b3-c8e5-4538-9e61-df7e6543c753-0
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.760
But the sighting also occurred
in a secondary forest, so we

29b868b3-c8e5-4538-9e61-df7e6543c753-1
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.478
need to add another clause and
in the first button here we want

29b868b3-c8e5-4538-9e61-df7e6543c753-2
00:02:09.478 --> 00:02:14.750
it to say 'and' not 'or' as the
sighting was a nest and it

29b868b3-c8e5-4538-9e61-df7e6543c753-3
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.520
occurred in a secondary forest.

869eafa9-868a-445e-bb74-a8710831b59d-0
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.556
And then our field for this
clause will be environment is

869eafa9-868a-445e-bb74-a8710831b59d-1
00:02:23.556 --> 00:02:25.760
equal to secondary forest.

1b7e3598-c3b7-41a6-b758-d840fc71cf9a-0
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:33.641
And now we can click apply and
click OK and now we can see that

1b7e3598-c3b7-41a6-b758-d840fc71cf9a-1
00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:38.480
that definition query has
filtered our data.

7b34b993-7b63-4904-9382-45b9d349b8a8-0
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.222
So the only points that we can
see on our map are the points

7b34b993-7b63-4904-9382-45b9d349b8a8-1
00:02:43.222 --> 00:02:45.760
that fit the criteria that we
set.

531025b6-0907-46a5-b31f-2962e3277d52-0
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.105
So we know our sighting occurred
in Wonegizi protected area which

531025b6-0907-46a5-b31f-2962e3277d52-1
00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:55.240
for me is the orange coloured
Polygon.

978a0a51-ba50-45e2-a70d-ad5ca6755b9f-0
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.571
And as we only have one data
point here, that is a nest

978a0a51-ba50-45e2-a70d-ad5ca6755b9f-1
00:03:00.571 --> 00:03:05.263
sighting in a secondary forest,
this must be where our missing

978a0a51-ba50-45e2-a70d-ad5ca6755b9f-2
00:03:05.263 --> 00:03:09.508
nest sighting is, where there
should have been two nests

978a0a51-ba50-45e2-a70d-ad5ca6755b9f-3
00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:13.680
recorded instead of one. And
just remember to hit save.
