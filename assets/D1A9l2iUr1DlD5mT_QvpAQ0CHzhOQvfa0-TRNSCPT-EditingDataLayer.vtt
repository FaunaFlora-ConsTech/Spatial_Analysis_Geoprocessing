00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.876
In this video, we're going to
edit our Sightings data layer so

184859df-3fa5-4f3a-84e2-34314e86a8de-1
00:00:05.876 --> 00:00:08.600
that we can add a new sighting
point.

5be2d223-deae-4b8d-8d58-cf3cee115b87-0
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:17.767
To edit a data layer you want to
click on the layer in your

5be2d223-deae-4b8d-8d58-cf3cee115b87-1
00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:25.400
contents and then go into the
Edit tab and look in the

5be2d223-deae-4b8d-8d58-cf3cee115b87-2
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.759
Features section.

fa3b0891-71c3-4ab1-8e37-5813be848dc6-0
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.208
So in this section we have the
Create button which lets us add

fa3b0891-71c3-4ab1-8e37-5813be848dc6-1
00:00:35.208 --> 00:00:41.200
new features to our layers, so
new points, lines or polygons.

2811253c-88e6-40b3-b39d-688fb776bc5c-0
00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.848
The Modify button lets us change
the existing features, so move

2811253c-88e6-40b3-b39d-688fb776bc5c-1
00:00:46.848 --> 00:00:51.160
points or reshape polygons or
rotate lines for example.

7387441d-0d18-4e58-a0a3-0f027d5999ab-0
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.578
And the Delete button allows us
to delete features, so we could

7387441d-0d18-4e58-a0a3-0f027d5999ab-1
00:00:56.578 --> 00:01:00.982
delete one of our sighting
points if we wanted to. But we

7387441d-0d18-4e58-a0a3-0f027d5999ab-2
00:01:00.982 --> 00:01:05.688
want to create a new sighting,
so we're going to click on the

7387441d-0d18-4e58-a0a3-0f027d5999ab-3
00:01:05.688 --> 00:01:10.320
Create button which will bring
up this Create Features pane.

363c0857-db67-43ee-bd2f-8107c8210094-0
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.042
So we can just shut the catalog
pane and we'll click on where we

363c0857-db67-43ee-bd2f-8107c8210094-1
00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:19.280
can see the point symbol for our
sighting environment points.

d910a553-970a-4f11-9209-74af06d7b92e-0
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.946
And now we have some buttons
here for different options of

d910a553-970a-4f11-9209-74af06d7b92e-1
00:01:23.946 --> 00:01:24.760
adding points.

16cd6926-9e43-43c0-9854-1e8d10b4e9c3-0
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.954
We just want to click on the
first button which is create a

16cd6926-9e43-43c0-9854-1e8d10b4e9c3-1
00:01:29.954 --> 00:01:35.063
points feature and then we want
to click on the blue arrow

16cd6926-9e43-43c0-9854-1e8d10b4e9c3-2
00:01:35.063 --> 00:01:38.440
that's to the right of our layer
name.

8b61e7d6-0a1e-4056-b788-2ce9822a6acd-0
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.447
This is going to let us add in
the information for our data

8b61e7d6-0a1e-4056-b788-2ce9822a6acd-1
00:01:43.447 --> 00:01:47.671
point that we're going to add
onto our map, so it'll bring up

8b61e7d6-0a1e-4056-b788-2ce9822a6acd-2
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:51.418
this window where we have the
different columns in our

8b61e7d6-0a1e-4056-b788-2ce9822a6acd-3
00:01:51.418 --> 00:01:52.440
sightings data.

c4f14c77-3781-4efc-b52c-2a446f9a2b77-0
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.169
So let's add in the attributes
that we know so the date is the

c4f14c77-3781-4efc-b52c-2a446f9a2b77-1
00:01:58.169 --> 00:02:03.131
same as for the other nest
sighting in the secondary forest

c4f14c77-3781-4efc-b52c-2a446f9a2b77-2
00:02:03.131 --> 00:02:07.680
in Wonegizi and that was on the
25th of November 2022.

5c27c3c9-5dca-4eea-b590-4ec6fe57623c-0
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.765
So we can click on the calendar
button and click on the top to

5c27c3c9-5dca-4eea-b590-4ec6fe57623c-1
00:02:14.765 --> 00:02:21.171
change the date 2022 and then
choose November and click on the

5c27c3c9-5dca-4eea-b590-4ec6fe57623c-2
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:21.679
25th.

7c4ba659-bc47-4c28-b80d-2ce52c274231-0
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.960
As we're going to add the point
to the map.

7034b112-6da7-4010-bb0d-022ce48244ce-0
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.312
We don't know what to put in the
longitude and latitude yet so

7034b112-6da7-4010-bb0d-022ce48244ce-1
00:02:32.312 --> 00:02:34.360
we're going to leave that empty.

44930ecd-71a5-45f6-89e7-8ef80a408fd4-0
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.973
But for sighting we can put in
nest and for environment we can

44930ecd-71a5-45f6-89e7-8ef80a408fd4-1
00:02:38.973 --> 00:02:40.640
put in secondary forest.

4f127784-2312-4e44-932a-ee6da7abd032-0
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.251
And now if we bring our mouse
onto the map we can see that we

4f127784-2312-4e44-932a-ee6da7abd032-1
00:02:45.251 --> 00:02:48.280
have a tool to drop a sighting
point where we want.

14290770-0af6-4276-b629-d2822d5171fa-0
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.389
So we're going to drop it in the
same place as the other nest

14290770-0af6-4276-b629-d2822d5171fa-1
00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.920
sighting in Wonegizi as this is
where our missing data is.

a184aff8-292b-4718-bdac-1c996618c16f-0
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.215
So drop that in and if you put
it in the slightly wrong place

a184aff8-292b-4718-bdac-1c996618c16f-1
00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:08.176
like I have, you can go into the
tools, click the move tool and

a184aff8-292b-4718-bdac-1c996618c16f-2
00:03:08.176 --> 00:03:14.138
once the point is selected and
it's highlighted yellow, you can

a184aff8-292b-4718-bdac-1c996618c16f-3
00:03:14.138 --> 00:03:19.448
drag it to move it where you
want and then click on this

a184aff8-292b-4718-bdac-1c996618c16f-4
00:03:19.448 --> 00:03:23.639
green tick finish button to
finish the move.

a754a387-9c2d-46fe-ab19-981980a9cca7-0
00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.480
And once you're happy with where
your point is, you can click the

a754a387-9c2d-46fe-ab19-981980a9cca7-1
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.800
Save Edits button which is up in
the Edit tab here and click Yes.

e61e16c6-19f2-41fa-a22e-61f4552f3201-0
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.351
So now let's open our attribute
table to see our new sighting

e61e16c6-19f2-41fa-a22e-61f4552f3201-1
00:03:42.351 --> 00:03:42.800
point.

955e6b45-f960-4276-8571-2d1a004dbd4a-0
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.760
So we still have the definition
query on our data.

206bcf8b-021e-4b09-b24c-70e036226a53-0
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.143
So we've only got 7 rows in our
table, but we can see at the

206bcf8b-021e-4b09-b24c-70e036226a53-1
00:03:53.143 --> 00:03:56.880
bottom we've got the new row
that we've just added.

533498a3-d92b-453c-803e-3ab39626c220-0
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.911
But even though we've plotted
this point, we still don't have

533498a3-d92b-453c-803e-3ab39626c220-1
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:02.880
the the longitude and the
latitude.

df46111a-fd87-4388-8214-8f9e1a22f75b-0
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.317
We need to calculate this
manually, so to do that we can

df46111a-fd87-4388-8214-8f9e1a22f75b-1
00:04:07.317 --> 00:04:11.922
click on the column heading for
longitude, right click and click

df46111a-fd87-4388-8214-8f9e1a22f75b-2
00:04:11.922 --> 00:04:16.455
calculate geometry and we've got
the rows selected that we want

df46111a-fd87-4388-8214-8f9e1a22f75b-3
00:04:16.455 --> 00:04:19.360
to calculate geometry for in our
tables.

f86bd82d-b2c4-489d-bfe0-a5b65ea81167-0
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.080
So we're only going to be doing
it on that row.

1f4002a0-7df6-48c0-acb7-1443dd18e74f-0
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.626
And in the input features we
want it to be our sighting

1f4002a0-7df6-48c0-acb7-1443dd18e74f-1
00:04:26.626 --> 00:04:30.200
environment points, which should
already be in there.

f84a75e5-e5f0-4fbb-b9d6-2c07a16fd593-0
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.720
And then for field that's going
to be our longitude.

1ff358b8-6d6e-496e-8f2f-811a94d2246f-0
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.063
And for property we want to
click X coordinate as we go

1ff358b8-6d6e-496e-8f2f-811a94d2246f-1
00:04:41.063 --> 00:04:44.120
along the corridor and up the
stairs.

043463e0-b845-4132-a711-b4450f014949-0
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.360
The coordinate format can be the
same as our input data and the

043463e0-b845-4132-a711-b4450f014949-1
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.800
coordinate system.

eb4159a8-8dd4-4735-ac8f-cefbd522b5c0-0
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.240
We want it to be the same as our
sighting points.

40b83405-15cb-42ab-b470-44f20436a071-0
00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:04.498
So we'll click on this and then
we'll click OK and now we can

40b83405-15cb-42ab-b470-44f20436a071-1
00:05:04.498 --> 00:05:10.920
see the calculated longitude for
that row.

b609e8ab-6836-4894-8667-840394d061db-0
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.120
So we'll just do the same for
the latitude column as well.

2db6f947-9cf9-4958-8a89-f74e87a9b34e-0
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.640
Click on it, right click,
calculate geometry.

4424d1ae-1690-405c-a638-a920e72fe0e8-0
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.987
The input features are our
sighting points, The field is

4424d1ae-1690-405c-a638-a920e72fe0e8-1
00:05:24.987 --> 00:05:29.532
latitude this time and the
property is point Y coordinate

4424d1ae-1690-405c-a638-a920e72fe0e8-2
00:05:29.532 --> 00:05:34.234
and then the coordinate format
is same as our input and the

4424d1ae-1690-405c-a638-a920e72fe0e8-3
00:05:34.234 --> 00:05:37.840
coordinate system is for our
sighting points.

44b2b43a-5db0-49b9-8422-e18216570262-0
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:48.371
So just click OK and that's how
to edit a data layer in Arcgis

44b2b43a-5db0-49b9-8422-e18216570262-1
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:49.000
