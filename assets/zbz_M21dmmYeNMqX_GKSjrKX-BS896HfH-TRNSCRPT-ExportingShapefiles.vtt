00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.683
The Protected Area authorities
have requested for you to share

27c6bea6-10f8-4731-a94d-769f96d0f09a-1
00:00:06.683 --> 00:00:10.957
the data for their protected
area as a shapefile and as a

27c6bea6-10f8-4731-a94d-769f96d0f09a-2
00:00:10.957 --> 00:00:11.400
table.

777493f7-fb8a-43d5-891b-a3f8c0ecfb81-0
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.880
In this video we will go over
how to export as a shapefile.

d148ae59-e93a-4d4a-b335-5f57017f1820-0
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.054
We'll be using the exported
layer for just the Ziama points,

d148ae59-e93a-4d4a-b335-5f57017f1820-1
00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:25.750
so the Ziama Sightings layer and
this is going to be a very

d148ae59-e93a-4d4a-b335-5f57017f1820-2
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.960
similar process to what we've
just done.

2eea096e-c862-4d7e-a20e-a2ca973ec6cf-0
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.750
We're going to right click on
this layer, we're going to go

2eea096e-c862-4d7e-a20e-a2ca973ec6cf-1
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.300
into the export section here and
we're going to choose Save

2eea096e-c862-4d7e-a20e-a2ca973ec6cf-2
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.077
features As and then the format
we're going to choose is going

2eea096e-c862-4d7e-a20e-a2ca973ec6cf-3
00:00:43.077 --> 00:00:47.400
to be as a shape file this time
and not as a Geopackage.

cf5032c9-c586-45a5-b002-1172a60287e5-0
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.545
So in format we'll choose
shapefile and then in the file

cf5032c9-c586-45a5-b002-1172a60287e5-1
00:00:51.545 --> 00:00:55.600
name section we're going to
choose where to save this to.

b834c143-a3d8-4474-ac28-7b060a9ef9de-0
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.920
And so we're going to go into
our Hippogriffs project folder.

0274790d-6d23-4212-be4b-518e7643e023-0
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.400
But now we're going to create a
new folder for the Ziama data so

0274790d-6d23-4212-be4b-518e7643e023-1
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.163
that we can send the data in
this folder to Ziama protected

0274790d-6d23-4212-be4b-518e7643e023-2
00:01:11.163 --> 00:01:11.560
area.

5a61f09a-719b-46de-83f6-b05331043df7-0
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.040
So what we'll do is we'll create
a new folder.

d07dc7d2-eeda-4d84-889e-6d5e3d6021ce-0
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.915
We're going to right click new,
create the folder, we're going

d07dc7d2-eeda-4d84-889e-6d5e3d6021ce-1
00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:28.900
to name it Ziama PA and now we
can go into this folder and name

d07dc7d2-eeda-4d84-889e-6d5e3d6021ce-2
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.720
the shapefile that we're
creating.

f9672a6f-7c55-4bde-ad52-906aa130a7aa-0
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.200
So we'll call it Hippogriff
Sightings Ziama.

3c2d1402-38a0-43b5-b63a-c3159f6c6018-0
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.120
Hit save.

f52ae929-edd6-4931-a3cf-250aa0f88043-0
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.525
And now all we need to do is
click OK and we can see that

f52ae929-edd6-4931-a3cf-250aa0f88043-1
00:01:50.525 --> 00:01:57.597
it's added this as a layer into
our layers list, but it will

f52ae929-edd6-4931-a3cf-250aa0f88043-2
00:01:57.597 --> 00:02:02.120
also be in the folder that we
created.

989e5aef-f206-4041-bcff-3d0d2c632dc8-0
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.541
So now hit save and do the same
thing for the selected points or

989e5aef-f206-4041-bcff-3d0d2c632dc8-1
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:13.960
the points layers for Wonegizi
and Wologizi.

864d232b-59f7-42c2-a8ab-035d82667030-0
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.800
So export these as shape files.

edafe85d-b1eb-492c-b94d-0df88825859f-0
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.097
Create a new folder for the
Wonegizi protected area and a

edafe85d-b1eb-492c-b94d-0df88825859f-1
00:02:21.097 --> 00:02:25.124
new folder for the Wologizi
protected area and store the

edafe85d-b1eb-492c-b94d-0df88825859f-2
00:02:25.124 --> 00:02:27.880
associated shapefile into that
folder.
