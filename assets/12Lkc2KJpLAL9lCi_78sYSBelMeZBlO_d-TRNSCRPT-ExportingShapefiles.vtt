00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.295
The Protected area authorities
have a question for you to share

60d51c34-7c66-4401-b618-18d63b7c77a9-1
00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:07.880
the data as a shapefile and as a
table.

4cce7e94-c749-462a-8694-358f0b446701-0
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.000
In this video we'll go over how
to export as a shapefile.

ece25cea-f5dd-4ffe-adca-d02efc5ffe23-0
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.254
We'll be using the exported
layer for just the Ziama

ece25cea-f5dd-4ffe-adca-d02efc5ffe23-1
00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:20.552
sightings as Ziama Protected
area will only be interested in

ece25cea-f5dd-4ffe-adca-d02efc5ffe23-2
00:00:20.552 --> 00:00:21.679
these sightings.

9aedadea-1a99-4afc-9a00-b5f362adbe29-0
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.972
And this is going to be a very
similar process to what we've

9aedadea-1a99-4afc-9a00-b5f362adbe29-1
00:00:24.972 --> 00:00:25.440
just done.

1dfb8c9c-2fac-4977-8f54-6f80bf92ddb2-0
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.194
So we'll right click on this
layer, we'll go down to the data

1dfb8c9c-2fac-4977-8f54-6f80bf92ddb2-1
00:00:31.194 --> 00:00:36.422
section here and click export
features which will bring this

1dfb8c9c-2fac-4977-8f54-6f80bf92ddb2-2
00:00:36.422 --> 00:00:36.680
up.

5423988c-f50b-43d8-aadb-0eadba7d616a-0
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.862
So our input features are our
Ziama sightings and now we just

5423988c-f50b-43d8-aadb-0eadba7d616a-1
00:00:41.862 --> 00:00:44.640
need to choose where to save it
to.

7b32a6ae-b0a5-4917-8d69-00cf11ba15c1-0
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.421
So we'll go into here and we're
going to create a new folder to

7b32a6ae-b0a5-4917-8d69-00cf11ba15c1-1
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:55.634
save it into so that we can send
this folder with the data to

7b32a6ae-b0a5-4917-8d69-00cf11ba15c1-2
00:00:55.634 --> 00:00:57.400
Ziama protected area.

49bc08b9-d294-40f8-bf53-f3d2df3bb819-0
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.117
So go into your Hippogriffs
folder for this project and in

49bc08b9-d294-40f8-bf53-f3d2df3bb819-1
00:01:05.117 --> 00:01:11.521
the Hippogriffs project folder,
I'm going to right click add a

49bc08b9-d294-40f8-bf53-f3d2df3bb819-2
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:17.824
new folder, I'm going to name
this Ziama PA click in here and

49bc08b9-d294-40f8-bf53-f3d2df3bb819-3
00:01:17.824 --> 00:01:23.720
now we can name the shapefile
that we're going to create.

d600c390-cfe0-426c-b8a5-39326e62b0b3-0
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.760
So let's make it nice and clear
what it is.

b8058a4f-650a-4139-a0c6-047aa062d54e-0
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.040
We'll call it Hippogriff
sightings Ziama and hit save.

425f5fde-ed33-4bee-b5a6-178ecbc3b224-0
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.401
And now to save as a shapefile,
we need to make sure that at the

425f5fde-ed33-4bee-b5a6-178ecbc3b224-1
00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:42.080
end of the file name it says
dot.

4e2eff33-bf2e-448b-bc28-f00044774c9b-0
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.440
It has the suffix dot SHP.

14005ceb-31b7-479a-8be0-569f64de2387-0
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.520
This will save it as a
shapefile.

03f06ce9-4c60-41d5-92c3-c1c2ea211406-0
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.488
So let's hit OK, and this is
going to export our layer so we

03f06ce9-4c60-41d5-92c3-c1c2ea211406-1
00:01:51.488 --> 00:01:53.960
can see it's come up in our
contents.

a221eaa5-5039-48bc-9171-e5fd5dad3f5d-0
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.483
But it would have also exported
the layer to the folder that we

a221eaa5-5039-48bc-9171-e5fd5dad3f5d-1
00:01:58.483 --> 00:02:02.400
created and so that's how to
export as a shapefile in ArcPro.

51bec526-5f4b-4046-8add-b1a33799f9c6-0
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.360
So now do the same process but
for Wonegizi and Wologizi.

fbbb25c2-ec98-4aa1-8b86-bd9ce83c668c-0
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.425
Create separate folders for the
two protected areas and then

fbbb25c2-ec98-4aa1-8b86-bd9ce83c668c-1
00:02:11.425 --> 00:02:16.250
save the associated shapefile
for that protected area within

fbbb25c2-ec98-4aa1-8b86-bd9ce83c668c-2
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.199
that folder.
