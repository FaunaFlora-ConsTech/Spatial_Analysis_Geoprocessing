ba55b8a3-635f-4e85-9a14-714536fbbfeb-0
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.061
In this video we're going to be
going over how to use the merge

ba55b8a3-635f-4e85-9a14-714536fbbfeb-1
00:00:09.061 --> 00:00:15.382
tool, but to start with, let's
just toggle off the territorial

ba55b8a3-635f-4e85-9a14-714536fbbfeb-2
00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:21.402
sea layer and we'll zoom in to
the clipped spawning grounds

ba55b8a3-635f-4e85-9a14-714536fbbfeb-3
00:00:21.402 --> 00:00:26.720
layer so we can see clearly what
we're working with.

814ba50d-0bcb-445a-be27-5befa6f1ef9c-0
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:36.326
So the Blue Zone around the
island, this is the current MPA

814ba50d-0bcb-445a-be27-5befa6f1ef9c-1
00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:40.360
no take zone that is in place. 

e96a938d-3cda-4358-a2be-a2148ed8046e-0
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.106
But the spawning grounds here.
This is where we want to create

e96a938d-3cda-4358-a2be-a2148ed8046e-1
00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:47.277
a new No Take zone during the
spawning season, December to

e96a938d-3cda-4358-a2be-a2148ed8046e-2
00:00:47.277 --> 00:00:47.600
March.

c52c8c21-cdf5-4910-a5bd-55633f75a693-0
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.967
So we want to merge this current
No take zone with the spawning

c52c8c21-cdf5-4910-a5bd-55633f75a693-1
00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:57.930
grounds so that we can create a
map that shows the No Take zones

c52c8c21-cdf5-4910-a5bd-55633f75a693-2
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.520
that there will be during the
spawning months.

09105354-e502-4360-8105-afd36ec907d6-0
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.560
So let's run this merge tool.

0562b456-412c-47be-81a6-fb837c389987-0
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:14.100
We'll type Merge into the
geoprocessing window and open up

0562b456-412c-47be-81a6-fb837c389987-1
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.360
the tool.

72a91dd4-f66a-4d7b-a41a-b83e23868880-0
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.773
And just a quick note to make
here, the Merge tool is similar

72a91dd4-f66a-4d7b-a41a-b83e23868880-1
00:01:20.773 --> 00:01:25.040
to the Union tool which we'll be
using later on in this course.

f0c17c8f-67c2-4d76-9e6c-000b59f6aaa9-0
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.038
But the difference is Merge will
combine the features of

f0c17c8f-67c2-4d76-9e6c-000b59f6aaa9-1
00:01:29.038 --> 00:01:33.034
different layers together into
one layer, whereas Union will do

f0c17c8f-67c2-4d76-9e6c-000b59f6aaa9-2
00:01:33.034 --> 00:01:36.592
the same, but it will also
create new features for where

f0c17c8f-67c2-4d76-9e6c-000b59f6aaa9-3
00:01:36.592 --> 00:01:38.840
the features in the layers
overlap.

0424ec71-c6c8-4fe4-b484-a978e4ec42e6-0
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.948
We only need the Merge tool for
what we're doing because we're

0424ec71-c6c8-4fe4-b484-a978e4ec42e6-1
00:01:43.948 --> 00:01:47.657
not interested in where the
spawning grounds overlap with

0424ec71-c6c8-4fe4-b484-a978e4ec42e6-2
00:01:47.657 --> 00:01:49.000
the current MPA zone.

42bb53d0-a411-43bc-8724-99691242fb75-0
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.320
So let's put in our input data
sets into this tool.

23181fa1-b96b-438a-a947-03d3775c4f5d-0
00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.642
So we're going to be putting in
the clipped spawning grounds and

23181fa1-b96b-438a-a947-03d3775c4f5d-1
00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:05.920
also the current MPA no take
layer.

03b1030d-5d57-4c55-a482-c844fa7db43e-0
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.439
And then for output data set, we
just need to decide where we

03b1030d-5d57-4c55-a482-c844fa7db43e-1
00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.751
want to save the new layer that
this is going to create and what

03b1030d-5d57-4c55-a482-c844fa7db43e-2
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:18.720
we want to name it.

6a5c9836-b851-40fe-8fb1-798942b0b77e-0
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.405
So let's just make sure it's
going into our Ge database and

6a5c9836-b851-40fe-8fb1-798942b0b77e-1
00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:30.680
we'll name it no take spawning
season and hit Save.

0da89500-d095-4933-ac0b-c0d0aafede73-0
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.125
And then we don't need to worry
about the stuff that's

0da89500-d095-4933-ac0b-c0d0aafede73-1
00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:35.120
underneath field map.

55bda262-6127-46c6-82d4-ea77a535cbb7-0
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.073
This is just if you want to
choose what things are going to

55bda262-6127-46c6-82d4-ea77a535cbb7-1
00:02:39.073 --> 00:02:42.400
be in the attribute table for
the merged data set.

cfab5851-4434-4585-8ad9-dd4f04ab09b3-0
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.756
So we'll hit run and now if we
turn off the MPA no take layer

cfab5851-4434-4585-8ad9-dd4f04ab09b3-1
00:02:48.756 --> 00:02:54.559
and the clip spawning grounds
layer, we can see that we now

cfab5851-4434-4585-8ad9-dd4f04ab09b3-2
00:02:54.559 --> 00:03:00.942
have a layer that has merged the
spawning grounds and the current

cfab5851-4434-4585-8ad9-dd4f04ab09b3-3
00:03:00.942 --> 00:03:02.200
MPA together.

b2721143-1ca8-4927-99a8-f0eff116194e-0
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.950
So we can open up the attribute
table for this layer and we'll

b2721143-1ca8-4927-99a8-f0eff116194e-1
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.600
see that there's four rows for
each Polygon.

543f0d8f-da3a-4fb3-8620-612f39ada654-0
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.048
And on our map there's the four
different polygons, the three

543f0d8f-da3a-4fb3-8620-612f39ada654-1
00:03:20.048 --> 00:03:24.016
spawning grounds, and the MPA
Polygon, and so it's merged the

543f0d8f-da3a-4fb3-8620-612f39ada654-2
00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:25.680
data in the table as well.

d98ef5dc-95fd-4e68-80e3-1eec377d7321-0
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.880
So that's how to run the merge
tool in Arc GIS and just

d98ef5dc-95fd-4e68-80e3-1eec377d7321-1
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.440
remember to hit save.
